Stripped down version: wall of text

The very basic version of this generates “Wall of Text” videos.

This is a simpler video request involving

1 “BRoll” scene with text over it
Transition to a product demo or CTA

This video style can get more complex and evolves into the first example shown

For instance, a listicle like “3 ways to _” with scenes + text for each demonstration would have multiple unique scenes and text displays
Wall of text requirements:

Text in center of the screen
Way to upload pre-filmed product demos to stitch into the end of videos
Ability to edit text post production
Different common font styles & AI able to “see” colors enough to make sure the font and color it selects on first go are legible
Ideally AI can generate different variants of the walls of text and produce these assets at greater scale
*Wall of text videos often do best with real humans but programmatic generation will allow us to velocity test concepts

Ideally this tool can support different video types with independent functions that can be re-used across formats.

I do not have a strong opinion on if it’s better to start w/ the most complex or simplest video type.
