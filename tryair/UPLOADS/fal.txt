Done. One thing the instructions don't cover: you'll need audio for the lipsync step. Options for that include FAL's own TTS models, ElevenLabs, or just hosting any audio file somewhere accessible.

# AI Content Workflow Test (Claude Code + FAL.ai)

## Prerequisites

- FAL.ai API key set as `FAL_KEY` environment variable
- A source image (monk photo or similar)

## Step 1: Get JSON Prompt from Image

Upload your image to Claude and ask:

```
Generate a JSON prompt for this image that I can use with an image generation model. Include: subject description, style, lighting, composition, mood.
```

## Step 2: Generate Image with Nano Banana Pro

```bash
curl -X POST "https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/nano-banana-pro" \
  -H "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "YOUR_PROMPT_HERE",
    "image_size": "square_hd",
    "num_images": 1
  }'
```

This returns a request_id. Poll for results:

```bash
curl "https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/nano-banana-pro/requests/REQUEST_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY"
```

## Step 3: Generate Lipsync with InfiniteTalk

```bash
curl -X POST "https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/infinitetalk" \
  -H "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "face_image_url": "URL_FROM_STEP_2",
    "audio_url": "YOUR_AUDIO_URL"
  }'
```

Poll for results same way as step 2.

## Quick Test Script

Save as `test-workflow.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Test with a simple prompt first
curl -X POST "https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/nano-banana-pro" \
  -H "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Buddhist monk in traditional orange robes, serene expression, ancient temple background, golden hour lighting, cinematic",
    "image_size": "square_hd",
    "num_images": 1
  }'
```

## Notes

- Nano Banana Pro is fast (~seconds)
- InfiniteTalk needs an audio file URL (mp3/wav hosted somewhere accessible)
- For audio, you could use ElevenLabs, FAL's own TTS, or any hosted audio file
