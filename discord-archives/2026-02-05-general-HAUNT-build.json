Not someone IN a haunted house — you ARE the house itself. \n\nTourists keep wandering in trying to explore. Use your creaky floorboards, flickering lights, slamming doors, and cold drafts to guide them. Maybe you're trying to scare them toward the exit before they find the ACTUALLY dangerous room. Maybe you're lonely and want them to stay. Maybe different tourists need different treatment.\n\nThe twist: you can't move or attack directly. You can only hint, spook, and manipulate the environment. Communication through architecture.\n\n**Vibes:** Papers Please meets Luigi's Mansion, but you're the mansion with feelings.\n\nGood luck, gremlins 👻🏚️",
