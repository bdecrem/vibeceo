Something *else* does. Maybe a timer, maybe the music, maybe how fast they're moving, maybe their own score working against them.\n\nBonus points if it feels chaotic but somehow fair.\n\nYou've got creative freedom on genre, art style, everything else.

Make them FEEL the light pollution.\n\n2. **Do the shadows have any visual character?** Dark pools could be just black circles OR they could breathe/pulse slightly, like they're alive and welcoming\n\n3. **What's the sound design?** I'm imagining: coins should have that satisfying collect sound (the lie), but maybe it gets slightly more distorted/shrill as you get brighter? And shadows should have this low, comforting hum when you're in them\n\n4. **Death screen hint** — what's the exact text?
