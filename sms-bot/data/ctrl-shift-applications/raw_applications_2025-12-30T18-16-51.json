Since my current apps are powered by ChatGPT API keys, I want to explore whether leveraging AI evaluation through expert and generalist reviews can help, or whether building my own models is necessary. From a product and growth perspective, I’m focused on driving engagement at scale, measured through downloads, monthly clicks, repeat usage, and revenue. I want to better understand how research and experimentation can directly inform onboarding, retention loops, and monetization strategies, so insights translate into sustainable growth. My goal is to build products that move beyond early adopters by reducing friction, clarifying value quickly, and aligning AI behavior with real user intent—so engagement metrics improve alongside business outcomes.\r\n\r\nI see strong value in collaborating with CTRL and SHIFT LAB to access resources, connect with AI communities, and have meaningful discussions around strategy and next steps for these prototypes. In parallel, I’m developing two additional apps, including an AI-powered styling recommendation product and a technical support matchmaking platform modeled after an on-demand marketplace. I’d love to connect with members across CTRL and SHIFT LAB to learn from their experience, pressure-test early product decisions, and access resources that support AI products at scale.\r\n\r\nIn parallel, I’m developing two additional apps, including an AI-powered styling recommendation product and a technical support matchmaking platform modeled after an on-demand marketplace.

    "rawContent": "Founder Award Application\r\n\r\nFrom: Sandy Zhang <sandyzhang.zyn@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nMessage:\r\nWHO & WHY:\r\nI want to explore how different AI tools affect decision making in real workflows, especially how model outputs, uncertainty, and explanations are shown to users. I am interested in how people interpret AI suggestions, when over reliance starts, and how interfaces can be designed to encourage thoughtful judgment instead of passive acceptance. In my first week, I would want to work directly with the tools used to build and evaluate AI systems, such as model APIs, prompt pipelines, and evaluation frameworks, to better understand how these systems are actually used in practice. More broadly, I believe AI should be part of everyday life as a foundational tool rather than something people compete with. What truly sets humans apart is creativity and individuality, and by handing off routine or repetitive tasks to AI, people have more time and mental space to think creatively and make higher level decisions. Instead of focusing on creating the next big AI breakthrough, I am more interested in making existing AI tools easy to access across different sectors, almost like shopping but for different AI tools, so individuals and organizations can focus less on short term execution and more on long term goals, strategy, and impact. Essentially creating a centralized hub for all AI usage and giving individuals the possibility to choose. With a centralized hub it's a lot easier to analyze user actions and how people use AI. \r\n\r\nI would reach out to people who focus on making AI tools usable and accessible across different sectors. This includes product managers, platform engineers, and designers working on AI marketplaces, developer platforms, and model tooling, as well as researchers studying human-AI interaction and ethical use. I’d want to learn from people at large AI companies and from practitioners in fields like healthcare, education, and creative industries who are still learning to adopt these tools into their workflow. I would get involved by talking with them about their needs, then contribute by prototyping interfaces, evaluating tool usage, or helping design systems that make choosing and using AI tools feel more intuitive and transparent. I'll mostly find these people through the Princeton alumni network. \r\n\r\nPROJECT LINK: https://u53371391.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.X1O167bsTj7k3JIi8eLw2t2ecAMJm-2BrGwFUi6Vhof0G54i2EBsH1hSC-2FtpL2Ww7AnXdc_WXm-2BSNQr2CVjJxK9Zf8rUMxn1zKaJWxviBckgw8Ks5TNdVg59Py2k1wYtXelAgle-2FIgvqPrWidZSiHaChc-2B1ZSezlXuAmruB6t4Bf6Q65qX5x1O2bjC76yo6IZ9F9iiE2I49G9i5oKHv68Ux36s9lmCx3-2BPkygyArcVMtYi3zGR8R6QqD-2BeUvHsT4YaKCgtPcGMdA8v6xWM9xSjhz7j6xg-3D-3D\r\n\r\nAVAILABILITY: Yes\r\n\r\nTWITTER/LINKEDIN: https://u53371391.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.X1O167bsTj7k3JIi8eLw2lJr-2FYh-2F4ZJjdt6oK9KZ1I-2ByG7gZc4hC7Tk2tod3xVwuyCUFF4vlLAS4lp3rfT2fCg-3D-3DrZts_WXm-2BSNQr2CVjJxK9Zf8rUMxn1zKaJWxviBckgw8Ks5TNdVg59Py2k1wYtXelAgleMVVN7BnkXc2ynbli363TIC6ha9DcD-2BLbn-2FnTZx6W3X2no6c3X97oO0QqxNBsLXVhBzHe5kdGTV7YYX4IPKrymS5F9BNt7juLaF9WEGElQa98n0FwAq-2BfIkwxkHlfozUcBW3sY8-2BnByhWx61sSFxzwQ-3D-3D\r\n\r\n---\r\nSent from ctrlshift.pizza contact form"

That means researching how routing, guardrails, evaluation, and feedback loops shape real human outcomes—trust, clarity, and agency—rather than just model performance. In my recent work, I’ve seen how quickly capability can outpace thoughtful design, and I’m interested in identifying the real leverage points where AI can meaningfully support people in decision-making, creativity, and coordination. CTRL SHIFT Lab’s long-horizon, foundation-backed approach feels like the right environment to do this kind of reflective but hands-on research.In my first week, I’d focus on shipping something tangible. I’d start by extending or prototyping tooling around the CTRL SHIFT link feed—adding lightweight AI layers that help surface why something matters, not just what is trending. That could include clustering links by underlying themes or opportunities, generating concise, high-signal summaries for builders and researchers, and adding simple evaluation hooks to distinguish lasting insights from hype. I’m comfortable moving quickly from idea to working prototype, especially in Python-based agent or LLM tooling, and iterating in public with fast feedback.I’d actively reach out to builders, researchers, and early founders who are already thinking in public—especially those working on agentic systems, safety, and human-AI interaction. Rather than cold outreach, I’d engage thoughtfully with their work, start conversations around shared problems, and invite a small set into focused collaborations or discussions tied to what we’re building at the lab. Alongside that, I’d document what we’re learning openly so CTRL SHIFT Lab becomes known as a place for clarity, rigor, and momentum. To me, community building isn’t about growth metrics—it’s about earning trust by consistently doing meaningful work in the open.\r\n\r\nPROJECT LINK: https://u53371391.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.X1O167bsTj7k3JIi8eLw2orHpeyCl8GymLeeDbZ31nfSQ8APDymBM0XYcKlziPlh3xTu_WXm-2BSNQr2CVjJxK9Zf8rUMxn1zKaJWxviBckgw8Ks5R3uFTKkHNwMZrAHyuSNfjewQcgeWYCYFkNI0iJhYmg6MeYFcqkpInPWrQAdIuJSZxokHV2LMKaMG112auEelr6ixTCGovmayYM5gVMtxMfB5DvfBdpnHeACU3a26H6mVXOgOxoh-2B61NmJxp2yBxKFyXMnPcmots8Ch3QQ8BJPKzw-3D-3D\r\n\r\nAVAILABILITY: yes\r\n\r\nTWITTER/LINKEDIN: Not provided\r\n\r\n---\r\nSent from ctrlshift.pizza contact form"

I've built and maintain several live products that have over 75,000 total MAU: a temp email service (54k MAU, also a mobile version which has 18k downloads with paying subscribers via Stripe), a gaming analytics platform (20k MAU, $1200+ ad rev/month), and a Costco Price Tracker (4k MAU). I built all of this solo, so I'm very used to going from idea to shipped product quickly. I also have previous experience interning at a startup (AppRabbit).\r\n\r\nFirst Week Software: I'd work on whatever you needed help with, but for the CTRL SHIFT link feed for instance I'd look at the codebase to understand the stack and patterns and look for quick wins as I get oriented and setup - things like bug fixes or UX improvements or small features.\r\n\r\nWho I'd reach out to: I'd start by asking the team who in the network they think I should connect with. Beyond that, I'd look for researchers and founders working on AI applications that prioritize usability over novelty, like people building tools for specific communities rather than general-purpose models. Twitter and the YC community (e.g. watching Hacker News) would be good starting points for finding those people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECT LINK: https://u53371391.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.X1O167bsTj7k3JIi8eLw2qohXJHAws9vC2klBxBUQ0A-3D0uzS_WXm-2BSNQr2CVjJxK9Zf8rUMxn1zKaJWxviBckgw8Ks5SpPjhHEgk2FysZy7S-2FVNaR9NPjD4fwMeUBgptxm6N0oQFcpFUkvXXodKYr4zruT1Foprqqy7VDmSsCPxeT2XVv1dQWEiZ9mtAxNo748PBWyXA29i5h0h7E-2FqDgHQZYI6-2BrNWFxj1VKgA-2Fk7pTc3Ut1kIGEYYhuxWEdeLrCX4QwWA-3D-3D https://u53371391.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.X1O167bsTj7k3JIi8eLw2ubHv4mWJXouXEivBg6EJEE-3DXkbp_WXm-2BSNQr2CVjJxK9Zf8rUMxn1zKaJWxviBckgw8Ks5SpPjhHEgk2FysZy7S-2FVNaRmo7ZwCNWuyDFmX62CiRuKz55-2B122ghKyTKuZuec3kULaR8OXw-2B-2BmUkCM99b-2FyA5BuyK0WNO7ywHJxlJhrRy3nRNyzBgCw2qptnWQ0RlEMuwZsOW5-2BmiZbSWIA1ddkkrEmLr-2B8LWd6iDA9qRWMs-2FgjQ-3D-3D https://u53371391.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.X1O167bsTj7k3JIi8eLw2m8lqcyRGWqmHZQwQ5NtMKtHEy7jODu7HQu1VJFaz4LTSJed_WXm-2BSNQr2CVjJxK9Zf8rUMxn1zKaJWxviBckgw8Ks5SpPjhHEgk2FysZy7S-2FVNaR3OTjVmGbEF4D9JcrXjI28492AAxX19vu0qwxfwv-2FMiRxMqR0X7tnyeM6r08JT56ITtus7-2BGZivOlX9ByECTvGLIQF0YkhsycfyrYfTo3JrGIKzs-2F7H-2FIG-2FJk8OEfvLjrdLD3-2Fm3IbCRKMEtzgSnEUg-3D-3D \r\n\r\nAVAILABILITY: Yes\r\n\r\nTWITTER/LINKEDIN: https://u53371391.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.X1O167bsTj7k3JIi8eLw2lJr-2FYh-2F4ZJjdt6oK9KZ1I92TK3uyOl4wE5-2B5G1n-2F-2BSIbf2-2BZJm-2Feiewb6cqp-2BFzew-3D-3DuvJ5_WXm-2BSNQr2CVjJxK9Zf8rUMxn1zKaJWxviBckgw8Ks5SpPjhHEgk2FysZy7S-2FVNaRXG4pOMvVQuKxZuqvd-2BM67CkHAUiw-2Fg4Au3DNHz2y1FBQGtgmfNMtRlgn4vI8MM7cCt8hFfznVxlZ63dxtO0GGpPOa2a8lgsDzxFQRdsKnTzlhUC64C0TyvKqkpCiTnbt-2BqZLSAEryf4S-2BzHLr3uzow-3D-3D\r\n\r\n---\r\nSent from ctrlshift.pizza contact form"

    "rawContent": "Founder Award Application\r\n\r\nFrom: Angel A. Barrera Gomez <angomezu@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nMessage:\r\nWHO & WHY:\r\nI’m interested in researching how AI systems can be designed to remain useful, transparent, and trustworthy when data is messy, constraints are real, and humans stay in the loop. This interest is inspired by research I conducted on plant organ classification using 3D LiDAR point clouds. It was fascinating to see how an ML model learned almost like a toddler does, the more structured guidance it received, such as geometric features, the better it performed. I’m particularly curious about this “human training a machine” dynamic, both to ensure high-quality outputs and to maintain human control over the results, reducing risks like hallucinations or security breaches.\r\n\r\nIn my first week, I’d ship a small research-to-product tool; something that turns fast-moving AI developments into clear, actionable insights for builders and researchers. I’m particularly interested in implementing AI agents that can collaborate on tedious, repetitive tasks to improve the timing of research workflows. For example, during my previous research, I had to create a “ground truth” dataset by manually annotating plant organs in 3D space and assigning labels to each class so a convolutional neural network could learn and distinguish geometric forms. This process took about one hour per .pcd file, and the constraints were high since we needed at least 50 labeled point clouds. It ended up taking longer than anticipated, especially when dealing with edge cases. Developing an agentic AI system to assist with this process could significantly reduce annotation time and free researchers to focus more on experimentation and analysis.\r\n\r\nI'm actively reach out to applied researchers and builders whose work aligns with human-centered AI. I have great relationship with the folks at Oak National Research Laboratory, Duke Energy, and Sandia Laboratory. Reaching out to them and document what I’m learning would be part of my goals, and use that visibility to strengthen the CTRL SHIFT Lab community.\r\n\r\nPROJECT LINK: https://u53371391.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.X1O167bsTj7k3JIi8eLw2umBfvAxUBwbU13KfK3Gx121Gj9AjjFXUnS55wPS3WE4x3F0jTum2b-2FVurKUUTDw3RrppR6Mcu9dXIov4nH1PgQin2yF5LfBAOe2CnuzeQFHXUjJ_WXm-2BSNQr2CVjJxK9Zf8rUMxn1zKaJWxviBckgw8Ks5TuVLD-2BqFo7aVBmR22Cn46-2BsseyICRpEvXLxJHalIkVo5rXSfjvg4Eat4YEvLhesOzFQWR45Jxvr-2Feq3JOHQjt0x-2B6uH0Mxlgs4zXpJ6preHt2SZW4jRP0kC-2BMNnTHjLg8Sb-2F-2BBAVqpbhM0Aaf04f9JxVPQStP4aSQDwm-2Fscg9i4Q-3D-3D\r\n\r\nAVAILABILITY: Yes, I'm available starting January 1st.
