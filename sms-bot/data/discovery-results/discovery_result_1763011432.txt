Hey! I searched for what Bijan (Sabet) has said about crypto. Here's what I found:

Bijan Sabet is the co-founder of Spark Capital and former US Ambassador to the Czech Republic. While he hasn't published many public statements specifically about crypto, here's his connection to the space:

1. SPARK CAPITAL'S CRYPTO INVESTMENTS
Spark Capital (which Bijan co-founded in 2005) has invested in several crypto companies including:
- Coinbase (crypto exchange)
- Fireblocks (digital asset custody platform)
- Optimism (Ethereum L2 scaling solution)

2. STEPPING BACK FROM VC (2021)
In Sept 2021, Bijan announced he was transitioning from General Partner to Limited Partner at Spark Capital

3. NFT INVOLVEMENT
He has an NFT collection and artwork on KnownOrigin (an NFT marketplace)

Note: Bijan Sabet (VC) is different from Bijan Alizadeh (founder of Cypher Capital, a crypto-focused VC in Dubai).

Bijan doesn't appear to have written extensively about crypto publicly on his blog or Medium. Most of his crypto involvement has been through Spark Capital's investments rather than public commentary.

Want me to search for something more specific about his views or other crypto topics?
