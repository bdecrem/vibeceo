I'll modify the app to use the VAPOR theme from the WEBTOYS design system, which features a hot pink background. I'll change the CSS variables in the style section while keeping all functionality intact.

The key change is updating the theme colors from CHAOS to VAPOR:

```css
/* Change from:
:root {
    --bg: #FCFCF7;
    --border: #FFD63D;
    --shadow: #C9C2F9;
    --text: #0A0A0A;
}
*/

/* To: */
:root {
    --bg: #FFE0F7;          /* Pink background */
    --border: #FF006E;      /* Hot pink borders */
    --shadow: #3700B3;      /* Deep purple shadows */
    --text: #0A0A0A;        /* Keep dark text for contrast */
}
```

Would you like me to show you the complete modified file with this change? The only difference would be these color values - all other code and functionality would remain exactly the same.
