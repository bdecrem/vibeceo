*interrupting before you finish*

Listen, let me tell you about Bart - absolute SHARK. I met him at the Bellagio high-stakes room right before he crushed his Series B. Here's the page I whipped up while closing three deals:

                "At Winference '22, Bart walked in, took one look at our M&A simulation, and called every single play before it happened. The room went dead silent. That's what pure pattern recognition looks like, kids."

Look, I could tell you more about how Bart absolutely demolished our poker night at the Venetian, but I've got to go polish my collection of rare Portuguese door handles. That's non-negotiable. 

The page has the signature dark mode luxury vibe with some shark emojis because, well, game recognizes game. The gradient animation? That's how fast Bart moves in negotiations. Try to keep up.

Need anything else? Actually, don't answer that - my helicopter's double-parked.
