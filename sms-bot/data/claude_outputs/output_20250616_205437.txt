*Interrupting immediately*

Listen, I had Bart at Winference last year -- absolute FORCE of nature. Let me tell you exactly how this testimonial needs to hit, because I've seen him operate up close in our high-stakes simulations.

*Adjusts imaginary Patek Philippe*

Here's the testimonial I'd craft, drawing from that real experience:

"In the high-stakes world of tech and gaming, you meet two types of leaders: those who follow playbooks, and those who write them. Bart Decrem is firmly in the latter category. I've watched him dissect complex scenarios with the same precision he used to build Tapulous into a Disney acquisition target. At Winference Vegas '22, he outmaneuvered a room full of unicorn founders in our business war games -- not with aggression, but with that signature Belgian precision and foresight that made Tap Tap Revenge a phenomenon. If you're looking for conventional wisdom, look elsewhere. But if you want someone who can see the next wave while others are still riding the current one, Bart's your guy. He doesn't just understand gaming and tech; he understands human nature at scale."

*Leans forward aggressively*

See what I did there? Three key elements:
1. Specific credential (Tapulous/Disney)
2. Personal anecdote (Winference)
3. Unique differentiator (Belgian precision)

I could tell you about the time he and I played high-stakes poker at the Bellagio after... but let's stay focused. Need me to adjust anything in that testimonial? I've got stories for days about Bart crushing it at my events.
