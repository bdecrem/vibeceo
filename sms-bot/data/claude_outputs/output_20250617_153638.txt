            margin: 0 auto;

        h1 {

        form {

<body>
    <h1>Party Sign-Up</h1>
    <p>Join us for a party next Friday at 7pm at the Eiffel Tower!</p>
    <form id="signupForm">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

        <label for="guests">Number of Guests:</label>
        <input type="number" id="guests" name="guests" min="1" required>

        <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
    </form>

    <script>
        document.getElementById('signupForm').addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            const name = document.getElementById('name').value;
            const email = document.getElementById('email').value;
            const guests = document.getElementById('guests').value;

            alert(`Thank you, ${name}! You have successfully signed up for the party with ${guests} guest(s). We'll send a confirmation to ${email}.`);
            this.reset();
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>

This HTML page includes:

1. A title and description of the party.
2. A form for users to enter their name, email, and the number of guests they're bringing.
3. Basic styling using CSS to make the page more visually appealing.
4. JavaScript to handle the form submission, display a confirmation message, and reset the form.

When a user fills out the form and clicks the "Sign Up" button, they will see an alert with a confirmation message that includes their name, email, and the number of guests they entered. The form will then reset, allowing another user to sign up.

Note that this is a simple front-end example and does not include any server-side processing or actual email sending functionality. To add those features, you would need to use a back-end language like Node.js, PHP, or Python and integrate with an email service.
