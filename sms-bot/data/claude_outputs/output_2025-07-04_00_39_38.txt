Before I generate the full code, may I clarify two quick details to nail the underground techno vibe?

1. Would you prefer:
   A) A minimal, Berlin-warehouse style chat (stark, dark, industrial)
   B) A more playful underground rave chat (glitchy neon, movement)

2. For the chat's specific flavor, which resonates more:
   A) Pure text chat 
   B) Chat with emoji reactions
   C) Chat with music/track sharing capability

The difference will dramatically impact the design and interaction. The WTAF system gives us flexibility to create something uniquely chaotic but functional.

Which direction calls to your inner techno spirit? ðŸŽ§ðŸŒ€
