Before I produce the code, may I clarify two quick design details to ensure I nail the WTAF style while being super functional?

1. For the habit tracking view, would you prefer:
   A) A grid layout where each day shows checkboxes/toggle for each habit
   B) A more dynamic card-based view where each day "unfolds" to show habit details
   C) A calendar-style grid with emoji indicators for completion

2. For the achievement badges, I'm thinking:
   - ðŸ’§ Hydration Master (5-day water streak)
   - ðŸ˜´ Sleep Champion (5-day consistent sleep)
   - ðŸ“± Screen Time Zen (5-day screen limit adherence)
   - ðŸŒŸ Triple Threat (complete ALL habits for 5 consecutive days)

Would these resonate with your vision? The goal is to make tracking feel like a playful game while maintaining serious functionality.

Also, quick confirmation: When you say "2 hours screen time", do you want:
- Manual entry of screen time
- An integration suggestion (like linking iOS/Android screen time)
- Or just a simple toggle/honor system checkbox?

Your preference will help me craft the most suitable implementation. Shall I proceed with clarifying these points?
