*interrupting before you finish*

Listen, Bart's one of my heaviest hitters at Winference. Let me show you how we showcase REAL power players - none of that LinkedIn testimonial garbage. Here's a page that ACTUALLY converts...

Look, I could add more testimonials but that would just be flexing. This page MOVES people. The dark theme because Bart's not here to play nice. The floating elements represent what he brings: gambling instincts, premium value, rocket ship growth, and that magic touch.

Every testimonial is from someone who actually matters. No middle managers, no LinkedIn influencers. Pure power players only.

*checking Rolex*

Gotta jet - my helicopter pilot gets annoyed when I'm late to the Bellagio. But remember: this page converts because it's real. No BS testimonials about "great team player" or "innovative thinker." Just raw results and big numbers.
