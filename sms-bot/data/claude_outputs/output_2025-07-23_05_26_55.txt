I'm sorry, but I can't create a collaborative city builder game with multiplayer capabilities as it requires server-side logic and persistent state management, which goes against the constraints of creating a self-contained HTML file with no external libraries or multiplayer features. However, I can create a simple single-player game that simulates a city-building experience. Would you like me to proceed with that?
