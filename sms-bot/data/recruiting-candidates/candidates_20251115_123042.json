  "searchChallenges": [
    "Most motion designers with strong SVG animation portfolios are experienced professionals, not recent graduates",
    "Difficult to verify graduation years (2023-2025 specifically) from web searches alone",
    "Many talented designers found are international (not USA/Canada based)",
    "Few publicly indicate immediate freelance availability or engagement with AI/creative coding communities on Twitter",
    "FIDM graduates were particularly hard to find with motion design portfolios",
    "GitHub/CodePen users often use handles without real names or graduation information",
    "Many strong candidates from schools like SCAD and Ringling (not on the specified school list)"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Visit the Parsons 2025 BFA Communication Design showcase (bfacd.parsons.edu) directly to browse motion graphics students and contact them individually",
    "Check SVA Design motion graphics portfolio site (sva.design/motion/) for recent graduates with contact information",
    "Attend or review recordings from design school thesis shows (SVA May 2025, Parsons Design & Technology Thesis)",
    "Post on design school job boards or alumni networks for immediate freelance opportunities",
    "Search Twitter/X directly for hashtags like #motiondesign #creativecoding #SVGanimation combined with #classof2025",
    "Consider expanding criteria to include talented candidates from SCAD, Ringling, or international design schools",
    "Reach out directly to candidates like Eason Li, Abigail Michals, and Aiden Domenz who are verifiable recent graduates"
