wtaf Make me a simple PAINT app with a nostalgic "MacPaint" vibe that has a pencil, brush, color and thickness slider, Undo button & a MYSTERY button that randomly toggles between a NEON SPRAY and a RAINBOW brush - just use a DICE icon for that (no words). Also a Gallery Wall that shows who created each shared piece. make the canvas square. Make sure the user can go back to using the brush/pencil after using the mystery feature. When the user hits SAVE ask for their name and post that below their art on the gallery. The gallery should immediately show all the art (not once the user saves) public
