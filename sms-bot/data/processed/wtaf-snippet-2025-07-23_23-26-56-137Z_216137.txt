wtaf make a public ASCII critter wall where anyone can pick a cute critter and add their name to create a colorful community gallery. The app should have a scrollable wall/gallery at the top showing all submitted critters in colorful tiles, and a simple picker widget at the bottom. Include 100+ ASCII critters embedded directly in the HTML - each critter should be exactly 5â€“7 lines tall, centered, made only with clean keyboard characters, and have distinct personality (mischievous cat, shy  ghost, curious frog, etc). Focus on expressive eyes/mouths, avoid complex linework. The picker should show one critter at a time with a "Next Critter" button to cycle through them, and when users find one they like, they click "I Want This One" which prompts for their name, then adds their selection to the wall with a random bright background color. Each tile should show the critter and contributor's name. Make it mobile-friendly with a fun, colorful design that encourages participation. public
