wtaf Make me a simple PAINT app with a nostalgic "MacPaint" vibe that has a pencil, brush, color and thickness selection, Undo button and a Gallery Wall that shows who created each shared piece. make the canvas square. have a MYSTERY button that randomly toggles between a NEON SPRAY and a RAINBOW brush - just use a DICE icon for that (no words). Make sure the user can go back to using the brush/pencil after using the mystery feature. When the user hits SAVE ask for their name and post that below their art on the gallery. public
