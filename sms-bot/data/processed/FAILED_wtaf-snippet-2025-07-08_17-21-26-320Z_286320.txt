make me a habit tracker app called "Three Things." When users first open the app, they enter up to 3 daily goals (like "drink water," "exercise," or "read"). Then each day, the app shows today's date and 3 big checkboxes next to their goals. When they check off a goal, it explodes with a random celebration emoji (🎉, ⭐, 🌟, 💪, 🔥, 🌈). At the bottom, show their current week streak. On Sunday, if they hit all their goals every day, trigger an emoji rain animation with 50+ different emojis falling down the screen. If they missed some days, just show a friendly "Nice effort! 🌱" message. Keep the UI super minimal - just the date, 3 checkboxes with goal names, and a weekly progress bar. Use Supabase to save their goals and daily check-ins.
