wtaf Make me a simple PAINT app with a nostalgic "MacPaint" vibe that has a pencil, brush, color and thickness selection, and a Gallery Wall that shows who created each shared piece. make the canvas square. have a MYSTERY button that that randomly adds one of 3 special features (such as a rainbow color brush) - just use a DICE icon for that. When they user hits SAVE ask for their name and post that below their art on the gallery. public
