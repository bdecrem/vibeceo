build me a ZAD APP that is a lightweight web app for up to 5 friends, where each friend describes a building they want to add to our shared street. When someone types "Coffee Shop" or "Bank" or "Library", use generateImage() to create that building and add it to our horizontal scrolling street view. All buildings should be generated in the same consistent architectural style - modern urban buildings with clean lines, similar lighting, and compatible visual design so they look like they belong on the same street. The street should scroll horizontally like a side-srolling game, with buildings lined up next to each other. Include a form where users can type their building description, and show all the buildings from everyone in a long horizontal row that you can scroll through.
