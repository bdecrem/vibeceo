make a ZAD app where up to 5 users each choose one critter from a shared list of 9 ASCII characters, and their selections get added to a shared wall. Each ASCII critter should be: Exactly 5 lines tall, No wider than 9 characters, Centered and balanced in shape, Drawn only with clean, readable keyboard characters (no Unicode). Style goals: Prioritize simplicity, personality, and charm — not complexity or realism. Each critter should be instantly recognizable and emotionally expressive. Think retro terminal sticker pack or early internet mascot. The face is the emotional core — make it cute, clear, and full of character using expressive eyes and simple symbols. Avoid visual clutter: no multiple layers of limbs, dense outlines, or unnecessary decoration. Example critters: a mischievous cat, a shy ghost, a curious frog, a sleepy bear, a proud duck. Each should have a distinct vibe but still feel like part of the same quirky family.
