## Market Sentiment

**Overall Sentiment:** Bullish

**Key Factors:**

- **Fear & Greed Index**: Jumped to 57 from 51 the previous day and 34 five days ago, moving from fear to greed territory ([CryptoNews](https://cryptonews.com/news/why-is-crypto-up-today-october-3-2025/))

- **"Uptober" Momentum**: October historically represents one of the strongest months for crypto, and both BTC and ETH are capitalizing on this seasonal trend with significant weekly gains

- **Institutional Confidence**: Consecutive days of ETF inflows for both Bitcoin ($627M) and Ethereum ($307M) demonstrate renewed institutional appetite after months of lackluster demand

- **Total Market Cap Growth**: Cryptocurrency market capitalization rose 1.4% to $4.22 trillion, with approximately 30 of the top 100 coins appreciating over the past 24 hours ([CryptoNews](https://cryptonews.com/news/why-is-crypto-up-today-october-3-2025/))

- **Technical Strength**: Both assets breaking through key resistance levels ($120K for BTC, $4,500 for ETH) with strong volume and on-chain support suggests continued momentum

---

## Risk Factors to Watch

- **Overbought Conditions**: Bitcoin's 15% weekly rally and rapid approach to ATH may trigger profit-taking and short-term consolidation

- **ETF Volatility**: While recent inflows are strong, Ethereum experienced $389M in outflows earlier this month, suggesting institutional sentiment can shift rapidly

- **Macro Uncertainty**: Global economic conditions and regulatory developments could impact continued institutional adoption

- **Resistance Levels**: Bitcoin faces psychological resistance at $125K (near previous ATH), while Ethereum needs to convincingly break and hold above $4,500 for sustained rally

- **Derivatives Exposure**: Record futures open interest of $32.6B increases the risk of liquidation cascades if the market corrects
