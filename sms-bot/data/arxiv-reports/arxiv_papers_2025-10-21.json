      "title": "Training-Free Spectral Fingerprints of Voice Processing in Transformers",
      "abstract": "Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic\ncomputations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted\n``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using\ngraph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in\nalgebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\\Delta\\lambda_2$) under voice\nalternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified\nearly window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural\nsignatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption\n($\\overline{\\Delta\\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\\!\\approx\\!-0.446$) while effects in 19\nother languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that\npositions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,\ndistributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and\nLLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures\ncorrelate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are\nmodulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early\nattention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the\nfindings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave\ndetectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that\nmanifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.\nBeyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,\nindicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing\narchitectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.",

      "title": "A Cross-Environment and Cross-Embodiment Path Planning Framework via a Conditional Diffusion Model",
      "abstract": "Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments\nneeds to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and\nhardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive\nparameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize\neffectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning\nframework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic\nmanipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable\nand Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a\ndiffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories\nconditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal\nconfigurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism\nthat combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with\nclassifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating\nenvironment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the\ndenoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments\nand robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that\nGADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in\nspherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance\nfurther improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong\nperformance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines.\nFurthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3\n(6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates\nits ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world\nsettings.",

      "abstract": "Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing\nmethods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We\nintroduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)\nto enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music\nmodels by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's\ninternal gradients to produce interpretable \"concept directions\", or specific\naxes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes\nor chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions\nwithin MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back\ninto the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step\noptimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including\ndynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of\nmultiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off\nbetween control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of\ngenerating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence\nremains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating\neffective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity.

      "title": "Learning Peer Influence Probabilities with Linear Contextual Bandits",
      "abstract": "In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about\ncontent, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to\nwhich such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,\ndependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,\nthe recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities\nhighly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to\nunderstanding information diffusion processes and to improving the\neffectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these\nprobabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations\nbetween peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence\nrelationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from\ninterventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or\noptimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher\ninfluence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence\nprobabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a\nfundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation\nerror, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an\nuncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains\nany pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network\ndatasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual\nbandits that ignore this trade-off.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing\nthe need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound\nImaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however\nthe sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate\nand private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as\nit is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive\nmedical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on\nnon-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can\nimpact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial\nfor accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to\ntackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to\nnon-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on\nenhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model\nwith attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%\naccuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour\nsegmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest\nthat FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise\nmachine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.",

Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large\neffect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity\ndrift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations.

      "abstract": "Modern weather forecasting has increasingly transitioned from numerical\nweather prediction (NWP) to data-driven machine learning forecasting\ntechniques. While these new models produce probabilistic forecasts to quantify\nuncertainty, their training and evaluation may remain hindered by conventional\nscoring rules, primarily MSE, which ignore the highly correlated data\nstructures present in weather and atmospheric systems. This work introduces the\nsignature kernel scoring rule, grounded in rough path theory, which reframes\nweather variables as continuous paths to encode temporal and spatial\ndependencies through iterated integrals. Validated as strictly proper through\nthe use of path augmentations to guarantee uniqueness, the signature kernel\nprovides a theoretically robust metric for forecast verification and model\ntraining. Empirical evaluations through weather scorecards on WeatherBench 2\nmodels demonstrate the signature kernel scoring rule's high discriminative\npower and unique capacity to capture path-dependent interactions. Following\nprevious demonstration of successful adversarial-free probabilistic training,\nwe train sliding window generative neural networks using a\npredictive-sequential scoring rule on ERA5 reanalysis weather data.

      "abstract": "In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain\ntumor segmentation.

However,\nstandard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor\nregions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous\nboundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on\nhigh-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high\ncomputational resources and often faces challenges associated with class\nimbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into\nthe 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and\nprioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a\ntumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is\nutilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.\nThis study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,\nultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is\nthoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various\nperformance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that\nthe model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity\nof 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed\nmodel in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for\nreliable diagnosis in clinical settings.",

On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs\nand ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction\nof up to 80$\\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy.

      "abstract": "Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has\nbecome a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models\n(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training\nsetups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which\ndirection - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what\nwe measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation\nframework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary\ndimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive\nUncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training\nexperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,\nand Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -\nthe relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on\nmodel capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples\nat different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task\ndemands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final\nrepresentations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate\ninternal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the\nnotion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across\nmodel and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing\ndecision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks\ncan enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is\notherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update\nParameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the\nupdate dynamics of internal representations stable across different model\nwidths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,\nparticularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its\nweights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we\nshow that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the\npractical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM\ntraining. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that\ncorrectly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across\nwidths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling\nprimarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to\nlargely replace it with modified warmup schedules.

As an important component of\nHuman-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many\ndownstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,\nHuman-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or\nembeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh\nmodels, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where\nthe correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched\nusing a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human\nPose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from\nimages, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at\nthe same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning\nloss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and\n3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with\na simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:\nMPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset\nwith cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose\nretrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,\nwhere the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.",

      "abstract": "While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image\ndescription, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,\nSPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now\nuncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require\nsensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize\nerrors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for\ndetailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to\nguide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained\nerrors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,\ninterpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics\n(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new\ndataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with\nexpert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with\ngranular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,\nDOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed\nimage description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh\nachieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\\rho$) with the human judgments\nin DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type\n(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward\nfunction, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we\ncharacterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the\npaintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models\nstruggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene\ndynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both\nPoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as\nassistive text generation.",

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple\nclients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it\nvulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying\nentire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical\n(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain\nstealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers\napproaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the\ninterrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection\nby advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise\nReinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the\nBC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other\ncommonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR\ndynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy\ngradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure\nstealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number\nof modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%\nagainst six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.",

      "title": "Rectifying Shortcut Behaviors in Preference-based Reward Learning",
      "abstract": "In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models\nplay a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned\nbehavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward\nhacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They\nachieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting\nspurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)\nthat correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than\ngenuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing\nthese issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking\nproblem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach\nto mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by\nthe invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based\nReward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant\nkernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental\nresults in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the\naccuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces\nthe dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust\nframework for preference-based alignment.",

The severity of damage and the vast resources needed to bring\nlife back to normality make such reconstruction a challenge. This article is\nthe extension of our previously published work by conducting comprehensive\ncomparative analysis by integrating additional deep learning models plus random\nagent which is used as a baseline. Our prior research introduced a decision\nsupport system by using the Deep Reinforcement Learning technique for the\nplanning of post-disaster city reconstruction, maximizing the social benefit of\nthe reconstruction process, considering available resources, meeting the needs\nof the broad community stakeholders (like citizens' social benefits and\npoliticians' priorities) and keeping in consideration city's structural\nconstraints (like dependencies among roads and buildings).

Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often\nforces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,\nundermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape\nGeneralized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable\naxis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear\npartitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape\nfunction, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual\nexplanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we\npropose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend\nthe SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees\n(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART\nfor learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively.

      "abstract": "Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term\nnormalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized\nidentifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic\ninteroperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but\nperform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization\n(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)\nacross multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked\ndifferences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to\n77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal\nimprovement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings\n(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.\nBaseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama\nvariants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic\nalignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between\nterms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.\nFine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity\nand lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during\npretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene\nsymbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in\nGO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a\npredictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when\nit fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.",

To address the need for large-scale\ndialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks\nthat provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k\nconsolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,\neach paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.\nMentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM\njudges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped\ninto Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then\nemploy the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology\nusing intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to\nquantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.\nOur analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for\ncognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision\nfor empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance.

      "abstract": "Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet\noften fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A\nkey reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that\nnatural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning\ndiffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,\nthese encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,\nlimiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a\nmotion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace\nfrom a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict\nground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then\nalign the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new\nsubspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and\ngenerate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in\na state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual\nprompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,\nand VBench-2.0, along with a user study.",

      "abstract": "In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close\nto the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was\nalso empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on\nclassification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we\nshow that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient\nlearning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We\nshow that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies\nmaximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural\nactivities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an\nunderlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual\ninformation implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)\nbuilding a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is\nbased on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural\nactivity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural\nFisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the\nsensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an\nexpansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the\nproperties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors\ngive the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We\nfind that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,\nthe class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we\nnumerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices\nmatch, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate\nour approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance\ndecomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.",

To mitigate the bias, we propose Calibrated Principal Component\nRegression (CPCR), which first learns a low-variance prior in the PC subspace\nand then calibrates the model in the original feature space via a centered\nTikhonov step. CPCR leverages cross-fitting and controls the truncation bias by\nsoftening PCR's hard cutoff. Theoretically, we calculate the out-of-sample risk\nin the random matrix regime, which shows that CPCR outperforms standard PCR\nwhen the regression signal has non-negligible components in low-variance\ndirections. Empirically, CPCR consistently improves prediction across multiple\noverparameterized problems. The results highlight CPCR's stability and\nflexibility in modern overparameterized settings.",

This data\nstructure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods\nfail to fully exploit.

In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction\nbenchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior\nperformance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and\nachieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of\nrecurrent, transformer, and state-space models.

Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by\nguaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations\ncast by that agent. Previous research has established strong bounds on the\nperformance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate\nthe number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to\nwhat extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved if they are\ngiven a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of\nnominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness\nof such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the\nmechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when\nthe prediction is inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents\nare to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a\nmechanism with consistency $1-O\\big(\\frac{1}{k}\\big)$ and robustness\n$1-\\frac{1}{e}-O\\big(\\frac{1}{k}\\big)$.

      "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and\nis applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of\ndiverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as\nthey do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially\nhigh costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have\nreceived extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed\nrepresentations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by\nautoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing\nreduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we\ndecompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,\nthereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.\nIn addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the\nreconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates\ncompetitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and\nunivariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with\ndifferent contamination ratios.",

To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we\ndevelop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT\nobfuscation. We evaluate both internal CoT (reasoning traces) and external CoT\n(prompted reasoning in outputs) using toy tasks and more realistic environments\nin SHADE-Arena. We show that: (i) CoT monitoring performs accurately and\nefficiently without obfuscation pressure. (ii) Under strong obfuscation\npressure, some models successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading\ndetection. (iii) Models do not obfuscate their internal CoT as much as their\nexternal CoT (under prompt pressure).

The effect of verification manifests\nthrough interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)\nthe verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's\nsub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a\nunified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We\nframe verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem.

A transport regime --\nwhere sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --\nwhere sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's\nROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by\ncoverage.

Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,\nprevious attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in\nisolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce\nGrasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.\nEmpowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports\n(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)\nmodeling interactions between multiple prompts.

Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a\nmore accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more\nimportantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple\nregions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains\nthe state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5\non DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple\nprompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B\non GAR-Bench-VQA.

In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for\nmitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns\nof two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nreinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across\nLM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,\nand arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving\ncomparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this\ndifference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a\nmixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the\nother to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which\nstems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact\nwhen learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating\nthat the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in\npractical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL\nregularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our\nresults highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately\non-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully\non-policy data.",

      "abstract": "Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into\ntwo categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,\nsuch as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream\ntasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational\ncapacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained\nadaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen\nsubset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and\neffective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory\nconsumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT\nmethod that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory\nefficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,\nconnections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces\nbypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the\nbypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.\nEmpirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and\nunderstanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance\nwith as little as $\\leq \\textbf{0.02}\\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing\nCUDA memory usage by up to 60%.

      "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth\nuniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise\nprediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models.",

In\nthis work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to\nlong trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,\nnoisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we\nintroduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework\nthat separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and\nperiodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling\nlonger, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable\nperformance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than\nstrong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3\nas the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,\noutperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,\nrespectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an\nautomated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for\ncharacterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer\nhallucinations than prior systems.

Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless\ninteractions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and\nutilization mechanisms.

To this end, we introduce a new\nmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance\nand efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of\nhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,\ncognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information\nthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to their\ntopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based\ngroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,\nlong-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that\ndecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with\nGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in\naccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API\ncalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer,\nthe first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert\nstuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription.\nStutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with\nattention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with\nshared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on\npaired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter\ncorpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across\nall benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a\n31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading\nWhisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28%\ndecrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore.

Automatically harvesting information is crucial for\naddressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,\nranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster\nmanagement. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in\nterms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits\nthe effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)\ntechniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by\npreserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing\ntasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly\ndetection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR\nacross the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored\nDR algorithms and their application in future research.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel Lyapunov-Based Quantum Reinforcement Learning\n(LQRL) framework that integrates quantum policy optimization with Lyapunov\nstability analysis for continuous-time vehicle control. The proposed approach\ncombines the representational power of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with\na stability-aware policy gradient mechanism to ensure asymptotic convergence\nand safe decision-making under dynamic environments. The vehicle longitudinal\ncontrol problem was formulated as a continuous-state reinforcement learning\ntask, where the quantum policy network generates control actions subject to\nLyapunov stability constraints. Simulation experiments were conducted in a\nclosed-loop adaptive cruise control scenario using a quantum-inspired policy\ntrained under stability feedback. The results demonstrate that the LQRL\nframework successfully embeds Lyapunov stability verification into quantum\npolicy learning, enabling interpretable and stability-aware control\nperformance. Although transient overshoot and Lyapunov divergence were observed\nunder aggressive acceleration, the system maintained bounded state evolution,\nvalidating the feasibility of integrating safety guarantees within quantum\nreinforcement learning architectures. The proposed framework provides a\nfoundational step toward provably safe quantum control in autonomous systems\nand hybrid quantum-classical optimization domains.",

      "abstract": "A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such\nmeasures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In\nthis position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --\nthose computed on trained networks -- are \\textbf{fragile}: small training\nmodifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a\nmeasure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter\nchanges, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants\ncan reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization\nmeasures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For\ninstance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,\nand is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.\nHowever, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across\nlearning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based\nmarginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in\ndata-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is\nnot a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as\npath, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic\nPAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that\ndevelopers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.",

      "abstract": "Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world\nimage super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic\ndetails. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different\nnoise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although\nthis randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider\nperceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR\nperformance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference\nOptimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative\nmodels with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.\nWe construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and\nno-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human\npreference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and\nnatural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the\nstandard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from\noutputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection\nratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,\nwhile larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.\nFurthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively\nweights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group\ndiversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments\nacross both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR\nsignificantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world\nbenchmarks.",

While\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the\nnuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward\nhacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses.

Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a\nPersonalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional\nscores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a\nCritique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs\nbased on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a\nrigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms\nstandard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an\naverage 11\\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses\nthe performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to\nfaithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and\ndecision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they\nreason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose\nnatural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and\ninterpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative,\ncomposable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such\nas +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic=\"Systems\nThinking\"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning\nstyle, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework\nformalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families\n(Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed\ninto subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and\nsession-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic\nprocessing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By\ndecoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a\nreusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases\ndemonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and\nstandardized model behavior across domains.

Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the\ncomputational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with\ndynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed\nsettings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and\nstep-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed\nmethodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training\nfor LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key\ncomponents: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,\nand hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to\nsynergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads\ninherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models\nwith extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by\ntraining Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K\ntokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite\nof downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A\nHaystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput\nwhile preserving model accuracy.

This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by\ncapturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.\nTheoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of\ncorrect classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and\nlabel consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective\nattention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a\nhigh level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this\nprinciple across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks\noffer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration.

      "abstract": "We introduce \\textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional\nBayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD)\ntravel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel\ndemand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization\nproblem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This\nproblem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each\nobjective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and\nnon-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San\nJose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These\nscenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that\nincorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the\nbenchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three\nstate-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is\ndesigned to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms\nand their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models,\nincluding high-resolution digital twins of metropolitan road networks.

      "abstract": "Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given\nits initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across\ndifferent tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and\nheavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which\nlimits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and\nparameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model\ntowards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,\nto extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various\ntask inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify\ndiverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory\nmatching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory\nmechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we\nintroduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any\ngranularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich\nannotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which\nrepresents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified\ntracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++\nsets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different\ngranularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the\nmainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on\nwell-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide\naccurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL\nscaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent\nworks explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks\ncan hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To\nachieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for\ndeep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine\ncalling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.\nThe task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined\nground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries\nto handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer\npredictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground\ntruth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as\nexternal knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to\ntest whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary\nsearch documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer\nand the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and\ncooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can\nsignificantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various\nbenchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL\ntraining setups.

Although gradient-based\nmethods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation\n(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder\nscalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or\nzeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that\nrely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample\nefficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can\neffectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP\nin neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for\nbiology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and\nfeedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological\nlearning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain\nlearns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based\non the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,\nsecond-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how\nthese methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training\nand the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to\nview biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO\nparadigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.\nThis framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence\nbut also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design\nfast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.",

      "abstract": "Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of\nevolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping\nthem, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion.\nThis study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research\nproposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of\nCanada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three\ntopic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic\nModelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named\nCOFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.\nThis advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native\nfunction for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings\nhighlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains,\nBERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and\nemergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.\nAdditionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct\nprovincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based\nthematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a\nrobust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more\nequitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness\nof the scientific ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition\nwhere actors simultaneously cooperate to create value and compete to capture\nit. While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative\nrepresentations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for\nquantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory\noffers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical\nreport bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize\ntwo critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We\nground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating\ndepender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence\ncoefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize\ncomplementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept,\nmodeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We\nintegrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation\nand introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates\nstructural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental\ntesting across power and logarithmic value function specifications,\ndemonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the\nSamsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications\nachieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions\nprovide theoretical tractability.

      "abstract": "The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77\ntokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform\nfine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks\nsupport for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict\nits applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have\nattempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to\nenhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and\nfine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces\nof LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently\nwithout alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can\ndisrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,\nleading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.\nTo address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based\nprogressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP\nimage encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills\nknowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage\nCLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between\nthe LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns\nthe CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text\ncontrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid\noverfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment\nloss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation\ninheritance and contrastive tuning.

Current\nstate-of-the-art methods, such as partial diffusion in RFdiffusion, often fail\nto resolve this trade-off: small perturbations yield motifs nearly identical to\nthe native structure, whereas larger perturbations violate the geometric\nconstraints necessary for biological function. We introduce Protein Generation\nwith Embedding Learning (PGEL), a general framework that learns\nhigh-dimensional embeddings encoding sequence and structural features of a\ntarget motif in the representation space of a diffusion model's frozen\ndenoiser, and then enhances motif diversity by introducing controlled\nperturbations in the embedding space. PGEL is thus able to loosen geometric\nconstraints while satisfying typical design metrics, leading to more diverse\nyet viable structures. We demonstrate PGEL on three representative cases: a\nmonomer, a protein-protein interface, and a cancer-related transcription factor\ncomplex. In all cases, PGEL achieves greater structural diversity, better\ndesignability, and improved self-consistency, as compared to partial diffusion.\nOur results establish PGEL as a general strategy for embedding-driven protein\ngeneration allowing for systematic, viable diversification of functional\nmotifs.",

CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances\nloss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a\nprincipled correction term that depends on local curvature information.

In terms of implementation, our\napproach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient\nimplementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style\nmodels of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the\nquantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation\nmethods.

Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of\nspectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel \"Rebellious Student\" framework\nfor complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student\nparadigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial\nbranch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary\nspatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning\nstrategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via\nreverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and\n(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized\nusing decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining\nreconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework\nenhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free\nand training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.\nExperiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements over several\nestablished baselines with modest computational overhead, confirming the\neffectiveness of the proposed complementary learning paradigm.

      "abstract": "While Variational Inference (VI) is central to modern generative models like\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), its\npedagogical treatment is split across disciplines. In statistics, VI is\ntypically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machine\nlearning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint,\nwhere VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. This creates a\nbarrier for statisticians, as the principles behind VAEs and DDMs are hard to\ncontextualize without a corresponding Frequentist introduction to VI. This\npaper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for VI, VAEs, and DDMs\nfrom a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show how VI arises as a scalable\nsolution for intractable E-steps and how VAEs and DDMs are natural,\ndeep-learning-based extensions of this framework, thereby bridging the gap\nbetween classical statistical inference and modern generative AI.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually\ncompelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,\nentertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion\ntransformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs\n(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention\nmechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational\nbottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)\nimpractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we\npresent UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient\nand ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,\nUltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on\nglobal-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a\nlocal attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global\nattention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a\nspatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global\ndependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to\nreduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different\nlocal windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively\nscale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution\nfor the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and\nsuper-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations.",

Using Pangram, a state-of-the-art\nAI detector, we discover that approximately 9% of newly-published articles are\neither partially or fully AI-generated. This AI use is unevenly distributed,\nappearing more frequently in smaller, local outlets, in specific topics such as\nweather and technology, and within certain ownership groups. We also analyze\n45K opinion pieces from Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street\nJournal, finding that they are 6.4 times more likely to contain AI-generated\ncontent than news articles from the same publications, with many AI-flagged\nop-eds authored by prominent public figures. Despite this prevalence, we find\nthat AI use is rarely disclosed: a manual audit of 100 AI-flagged articles\nfound only five disclosures of AI use.

      "abstract": "Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons\nare arranged topographically according to their response properties, at\nmultiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning\nmodels lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces\nthat are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of\nself-attention that turns Transformers into \"Topoformers\" with topographic\norganization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are\narranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given\nkey - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected\nlayer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate\nthe feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment\nclassification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic\norganization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately\nencourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs.\nWe then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with\na masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant\nperforms on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet\nproduces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight\nlinguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain\nresponses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment\nbetween low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and\nhuman brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for\ngreater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the\norganization of linguistic information in the human brain.",

      "title": "Diffusion Buffer for Online Generative Speech Enhancement",
      "abstract": "Online Speech Enhancement was mainly reserved for predictive models. A key\nadvantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream of\ndata, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generative\nSpeech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in a\ncomputational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancement\napplications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative\ndiffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network\ncall per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement\nin an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion\nBuffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approach\nprogressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames have\nmore noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listener\nwith a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has a\ncorresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work by\ncarefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specifically\naligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposed\nUNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low.\nMoreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising Score\nMatching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmic\nlatency and quality during inference. The extended Diffusion Buffer equipped\nwith a novel NN and loss function drastically reduces the algorithmic latency\nfrom 320 - 960 ms to 32 - 176 ms with an even increased performance. While it\nhas been shown before that offline generative diffusion models outperform\npredictive approaches in unseen noisy speech data, we confirm that the online\nDiffusion Buffer also outperforms its predictive counterpart on unseen noisy\nspeech data.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).\nGiven a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled\nimages, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing\napproaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually\ndesigned abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and\nscalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware\nhierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and\neasily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a\nHierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits\nhierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the\nlimitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives\nequally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed\nto align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,\nincluding the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and\nfurther demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets.

      "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time\nview synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual\ncolonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static\nillumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,\nwhich causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic\nscenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS\nmethods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the\ncamera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately\ndegrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the\nillumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical\ncharacters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an\nimproved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance\nunder varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with\ntwo types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt\nto photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the\ngeometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved\nGeometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian\ngeometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is\nleveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.\nComprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our\nproposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and\naccurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while\nsignificantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.",

      "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view\nsynthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction\nartifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While\nrecent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of\nlarge-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient\nmagnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,\nwhere essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while\nsuboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of\nre-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification\ncriterion incorporating $\\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to\nre-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a\nre-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive\nparameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction\nartifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view\nsynthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,\nour re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with\nother 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.",

However, leveraging transfer learning\nis computationally expensive when fine-tuning large multilingual models with\nbillions of parameters, thus creating a barrier to entry for researchers\nworking on low-resource domains such as Irish translation. Parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) bridges this gap by training on a fraction of the original\nmodel parameters, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach introducing\nsmall, trainable adapter layers. We introduce SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA as\nsemi-supervised inference-efficient approaches that strengthen domain\nadaptation and lead to improved overall performance in NMT. We demonstrate that\nSemiAdapt can outperform full-domain fine-tuning, while most notably, SemiLoRA\ncan propel PEFT methods to match or even outperform full-model fine-tuning. We\nfurther evaluate domain-by-dataset fine-tuning and demonstrate that our\nembedding-based inference methods perform especially well on larger and noisier\ncorpora.

      "abstract": "Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large\nfoundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data\nscarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the\nreason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the\nembedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the\nmodels to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to\nprovide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on\ncode-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points\nwhere recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis\nemphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,\nwe leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to\nhighlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those\nlocations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context\nbias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby\nimproving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and\nChinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places\nmore correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.",

      "abstract": "To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features\n(e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in\nengineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key\nchallenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an\nintractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing\non designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about\ndata characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting\ntheir full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing\na generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.\nThrough causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most\ndirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive\ncounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a\ncausal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide\na test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves\nas a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.\nExtensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably\nimprove arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the\ncases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art\napproach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation,\nCausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more\nefficient.

Using\nplanar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -\nwe introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction\nfrom unposed two-view images.

Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations\nduring training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane\nsupervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using\nonly depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene\ndatasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to\nout-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation\nprotocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative\npose estimation.

While a growing body of theoretical work has\nemerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning\nlarge language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise\ncomparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,\nThekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and\nranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even\ndeteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information\navailable. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for\nranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that\nselects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the\noffered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{d}{T} \\sqrt{ \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{1}{|S_t|}}\n\\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature\ndimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result\nshows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,\nthe bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,\nwhich was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we\nestablish a near-matching lower bound of $\\Omega \\left( \\frac{d}{K \\sqrt{T}}\n\\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that\nexplicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.",

      "abstract": "Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,\nthanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,\ndespite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do\nnot perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate\nmotion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume\nin traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix\ndefined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling\ncapacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion\nmodeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,\nwith the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In\nEMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume\nstyle, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based\nneighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the\nconstructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for\nappearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling\nas well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four\nwidely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,\nSomething-Something V1 & V2.

However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web\ndocuments remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are\ninterleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified\nframework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single\nvision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all\ninputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the\nneed for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture\ncomplex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a\nsnippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal\nsegments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring\nexplicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this\napproach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,\ndesigned to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential\nunderstanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical\nresults show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nCLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such\nas M-BEIR and MTEB.

We demonstrate the deployed nature of this\nsystem through a decentralized logistics use case where autonomous agents\ndynamically discover, negotiate, and transact with one another securely.\nUltimately, the Fetch.ai stack provides a principled architecture for moving\nbeyond current agent implementations towards open, collaborative, and\neconomically sustainable multi-agent ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by\nthe quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention\nis highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key\npairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose\naccuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper\nintroduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention\nthat uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens\nwithout blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables\neffective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates\nseamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence\nparallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation\nmodel that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,\nwith a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on\nvarious video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions\nbased on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In\nmany real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,\nagents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide\nadditional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are\ninherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP\nleads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.\nMoreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented\nMDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot\naccommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We\naddress these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the\n\\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware\npolicy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \\emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis\non the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of\nimperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with\nOnline Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline\nBayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time\npredictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect\npredictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a\nreal-world wind energy storage control problem.",

However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains\nunexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in\nreal-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on\ncomparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal\nthat there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)\nsignificant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive\nrunning time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether\nexisting inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main\ntakeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can\nimprove service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while\nprefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving\nperformance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world\nworkload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical\nresults of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned\nwith our main findings regarding RLLM serving.

Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing\nand clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully\ncurated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process\nby learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments\nshow that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,\ndocument-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in\nthe test set are not present in the training data. We explore different\ncombinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and\npost-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and\nfeature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform\npoorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch\nrepresentations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one\nend-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,\ndespite using a simpler design.

To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a\ndialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy\nvia Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated\ndialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of\nbinary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space.

Assessing water shortages\nand reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for\nensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,\nwhich align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often\nperform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are\npowerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack\nadherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this\ngap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield\nis inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop\nyield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop\ndrought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.\nSequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield\nprediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss\nfunction is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,\nmeteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the\nuncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our\nmethod surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop\nyield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to\n0.82 while offering high explainability.

      "abstract": "Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,\nparticularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model\nreduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network\nand vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we\ndemonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in\nmodel size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for\nfine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the\nbest trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.",

      "title": "Think with 3D: Geometric Imagination Grounded Spatial Reasoning from Limited Views",
      "abstract": "Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved\nremarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D\nspatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.\nPrevious reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological\ncognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational\ncapacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial\nimagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that\ncan effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images\nwhile reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D\nmentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on\nexplicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of\ntwo stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent\ngenerated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,\nVGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on\noutcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive\nexperiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently\noutperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D\nrepresentations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/zhangquanchen/3DThinker.",

      "abstract": "Course syllabi set the tone and expectations for courses, shaping the\nlearning experience for both students and instructors. In computing courses,\nespecially those addressing fairness and ethics in artificial intelligence\n(AI), machine learning (ML), and algorithmic design, it is imperative that we\nunderstand how approaches to navigating barriers to fair outcomes are being\naddressed.These expectations should be inclusive, transparent, and grounded in\npromoting critical thinking. Syllabus analysis offers a way to evaluate the\ncoverage, depth, practices, and expectations within a course. Manual syllabus\nevaluation, however, is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. To address\nthis, we developed a justice-oriented scoring rubric and asked a large language\nmodel (LLM) to review syllabi through a multi-perspective role simulation.\nUsing this rubric, we evaluated 24 syllabi from four perspectives: instructor,\ndepartmental chair, institutional reviewer, and external evaluator. We also\nprompted the LLM to identify thematic trends across the courses. Findings show\nthat multiperspective evaluation aids us in noting nuanced, role-specific\npriorities, leveraging them to fill hidden gaps in curricula design of AI/ML\nand related computing courses focused on fairness and ethics.

To address\nthese limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel\nframework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a\nreasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key\nstages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT)\ngeneration, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction.\nThe search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and\ngeometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not\nfaithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for\nour search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution\nwith high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B,\nsets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and\nsafety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and\ndemonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.",

Although approaches\nbased on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to\naddress a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled\nin time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology\nthat leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods\nfor PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the\nsampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of\nequation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy\noptimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be\nexploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient\ndescent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method.

      "abstract": "Deep learning-based semantic communication has largely relied on analog or\nsemi-digital transmission, which limits compatibility with modern digital\ncommunication infrastructures. Recent studies have employed vector quantization\n(VQ) to enable discrete semantic transmission, yet existing methods neglect\nchannel state information during codebook optimization, leading to suboptimal\nrobustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a channel-aware vector quantization\n(CAVQ) algorithm within a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, termed\nVQJSCC, established on a discrete memoryless channel. In this framework,\nsemantic features are discretized and directly mapped to modulation\nconstellation symbols, while CAVQ integrates channel transition probabilities\ninto the quantization process, aligning easily confused symbols with\nsemantically similar codewords. A multi-codebook alignment mechanism is further\nintroduced to handle mismatches between codebook order and modulation order by\ndecomposing the transmission stream into multiple independently optimized\nsubchannels. Experimental results demonstrate that VQJSCC effectively mitigates\nthe digital cliff effect, achieves superior reconstruction quality across\nvarious modulation schemes, and outperforms state-of-the-art digital semantic\ncommunication baselines in both robustness and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for\naligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in\noff-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for\ntraining--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy\ndeclines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.\nThrough theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)\nan imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the\npolicy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;\nand (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping\nmechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing\nupdates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of\nexploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that\ndynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and\nnegative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across\ndiverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO\nachieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025\nbenchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as\nSkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art\nresults among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary\nsystems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.",

While script-based\nverifiers are widely adopted for evaluation, they suffer from limited\nscalability and inability to provide step-wise assessment. Reward models offer\npromising alternatives, but their effectiveness on CUA evaluation remains\nlargely underexplored. To address this gap, we present CUARewardBench,\ncomprising four key contributions: (1) First-ever Comprehensive CUA Reward\nBenchmark: We introduce the first benchmark for evaluating both outcome reward\nmodels (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) on CUA tasks, enabling systematic\nassessment across trajectory-level and step-level evaluation. (2) Diverse,\nPractical and Reliable Dataset: CUARewardBench encompasses trajectories from 10\nsoftware categories and 7 agent architectures with varying performance levels\n(25.9%-50.8% success rates). All trajectories are expertly annotated through\ncarefully designed protocols, with rigorous quality control to ensure\nreliability and practical applicability. (3) Comprehensive Analysis and\nInsights: Through extensive experiments across 7 vision-language models and 3\nprompt templates, we reveal critical limitations of current CUA RMs, including\ninsufficient visual reasoning capabilities, knowledge deficiencies, and the\nsuperiority of general VLMs over specialized CUA models for reward evaluation.\n(4) Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE): Based on the insights from our\ncomprehensive analysis, we propose UPE, a novel ensemble method that\nsignificantly enhances reward model reliability through strict unanimous voting\nand strategic prompt-template configurations. UPE achieves 89.8% precision and\n93.3% NPV for ORM, and 81.7% precision and 85.1% NPV for PRM, substantially\noutperforming single VLMs and traditional ensemble approaches.",

Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables\njoint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment\nand improved performance.

      "abstract": "Motivation: Standard genome-wide association studies in cancer genomics rely\non statistical significance with multiple testing correction, but\nsystematically fail in underpowered cohorts. In TCGA breast cancer (n=967, 133\ndeaths), low event rates (13.8%) create severe power limitations, producing\nfalse negatives for known drivers and false positives for large passenger\ngenes. Results: We developed a five-criteria computational framework\nintegrating causal inference (inverse probability weighting, doubly robust\nestimation) with orthogonal biological validation (expression, mutation\npatterns, literature evidence). Applied to TCGA-BRCA mortality analysis,\nstandard Cox+FDR detected zero genes at FDR<0.05, confirming complete failure\nin underpowered settings. Our framework correctly identified RYR2 -- a cardiac\ngene with no cancer function -- as a false positive despite nominal\nsignificance (p=0.024), while identifying KMT2C as a complex candidate\nrequiring validation despite marginal significance (p=0.047, q=0.954). Power\nanalysis revealed median power of 15.1% across genes, with KMT2C achieving only\n29.8% power (HR=1.55), explaining borderline statistical significance despite\nstrong biological evidence. The framework distinguished true signals from\nartifacts through mutation pattern analysis: RYR2 showed 29.8% silent mutations\n(passenger signature) with no hotspots, while KMT2C showed 6.7% silent\nmutations with 31.4% truncating variants (driver signature). This\nmulti-evidence approach provides a template for analyzing underpowered cohorts,\nprioritizing biological interpretability over purely statistical significance.\n  Availability: All code and analysis pipelines available at\ngithub.com/akarlaraytu/causal-inference-for-cancer-genomics",

      "abstract": "In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of\nalignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model\nto improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety,\ninstruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on\nmemorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction\nthrough string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for\nour specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model\ncan identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such\nas edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,\napproximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative\nestimate of $10\\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial\nartifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily\nregurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or\nRL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a\nmeaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a\npossibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work\nopens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation\npractices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,\ndistillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's\noriginal dataset.",

      "abstract": "Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the\nlocation of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents\nequipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation\nmaps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily\nrely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small\nLLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to\nlimited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which\nprevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt\nintroduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency\non local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device\nefficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better\nunderstand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to\nprune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we\npropose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to\nefficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on\nHM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time\nlatency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our\ncode will be released soon.",

      "abstract": "Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a\nsignificant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to\ninitial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning\nmethods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these\ndifficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first\nleverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,\nto decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both\nmacro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-\nand micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely\navailable in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct\nmultiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches\nensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the\nframework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale\nphenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete\nobservations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time\nscales present in the phenomena under study.",

      "abstract": "LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge\ndistillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.\nHowever, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation\ncan raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security\nimplications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,\nwe show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our\nkey insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose\ntrigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this\nunderestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new\nbackdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of\ntransferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor\ntrigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in\nanticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains\nstealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens\nprovides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using\nT-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable\nbackdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and\nacross four model families of LLMs.",

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into\napplications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and\ndemographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond\naverage principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such\nas Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple\nvalue dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods\nencounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:\n1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,\nignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)\nthey struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those\nunderrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we\npropose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE\nalignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex\ninterdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal\nrelationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it\napplies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired\nvalue objectives.

      "title": "Identity-Aware Large Language Models require Cultural Reasoning",
      "abstract": "Large language models have become the latest trend in natural language\nprocessing, heavily featuring in the digital tools we use every day. However,\ntheir replies often reflect a narrow cultural viewpoint that overlooks the\ndiversity of global users. This missing capability could be referred to as\ncultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to\nrecognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its\noutput so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because\nculture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour,\ncultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is\nlimited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority\nperspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies\nstrongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging\nmoral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning\non survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation\nmethods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive\nreasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone\nensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning\nmust be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and\nlinguistic coherence. By clarifying the concept and outlining initial\ndirections for its assessment, a foundation is laid for future systems to be\nable to respond with greater sensitivity to the complex fabric of human\nculture.",

      "abstract": "Phone scams remain a pervasive threat to both personal safety and financial\nsecurity worldwide. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong potential in detecting fraudulent behavior by analyzing\ntranscribed phone conversations. However, these capabilities introduce notable\nprivacy risks, as such conversations frequently contain sensitive personal\ninformation that may be exposed to third-party service providers during\nprocessing. In this work, we explore how to harness LLMs for phone scam\ndetection while preserving user privacy. We propose MASK (Modular Adaptive\nSanitization Kit), a trainable and extensible framework that enables dynamic\nprivacy adjustment based on individual preferences. MASK provides a pluggable\narchitecture that accommodates diverse sanitization methods - from traditional\nkeyword-based techniques for high-privacy users to sophisticated neural\napproaches for those prioritizing accuracy. We also discuss potential modeling\napproaches and loss function designs for future development, enabling the\ncreation of truly personalized, privacy-aware LLM-based detection systems that\nbalance user trust and detection effectiveness, even beyond phone scam context.",

We ask whether current vision-language models (VLMs) can\ndo the same. Despite encouraging results under simplified control or tool\nscaffolds, human-like play in a real client - mapping raw screenshots to\ntemporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance -\nremains an open challenge. We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark\nderived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies:\nmultimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information\nseeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two\nregimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive\nonly screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with\nno semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents\ncan be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional\ntextualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice,\nStarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when\nagents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice\naffects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary\nVLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in\nperception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that\njudicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing\nStarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and\nmultimodal decision-making in real-client play.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to\nthe long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable\ndecoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current\nopen-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting\ntheir real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM\nefficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through\nempirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we\ndemonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs\nconsistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that\ntechniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small\nbatch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings\nunderscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration\nstrategies to advance research on DLMs.",

Yet existing approaches struggle\nto strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple\ntask performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints\nfrequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients\nand stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a\nnovel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into\ncritic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions\nwhile preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve\neffective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces\nsafety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher\nrewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by\napproximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and\nperformance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data\nanalytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating\nmulti-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics\nframeworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering\nlittle to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables\nprivacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks\nsupport for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable\nqueries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates\nLLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical\nmulti-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms\nthem into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first\ndecomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps\neach subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior\nstructural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent\nrewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and\nminimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by\nachieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive\nFA operations by a substantial margin.

      "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from\nvast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on\ntextual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by\nformal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from\nexecuting test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is\ninefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual\nrepresentation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle\nlogical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel\napproach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training\npipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level\nexecution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution\nsemantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using\nexisting on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL\nalgorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms\npost-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6%\naverage relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to\nother coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning\nand test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively.

Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into\nspatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains\nattention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent\nattention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative\nrepresentations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and\nadaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt\nSE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types\nas prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up\nto 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining\nthe best forecasting accuracy.",

To address this, we developed a\nWordNet annotated with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages\n(CEFR), integrating its semantic networks with language-proficiency levels. We\nautomated this process using a large language model to measure the semantic\nsimilarity between sense definitions in WordNet and entries in the English\nVocabulary Profile Online. To validate our method, we constructed a large-scale\ncorpus containing both sense and CEFR-level information from our annotated\nWordNet and used it to develop contextual lexical classifiers. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that models fine-tuned on our corpus perform comparably to those\ntrained on gold-standard annotations. Furthermore, by combining our corpus with\nthe gold-standard data, we developed a practical classifier that achieves a\nMacro-F1 score of 0.81, indicating the high accuracy of our annotations.

Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse\nKullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based\nmethods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation\nand rely heavily on schedule tuning.

      "abstract": "Short video streaming has become a dominant paradigm in digital media,\ncharacterized by rapid swiping interactions and diverse media content. A key\ntechnical challenge is designing an effective preloading strategy that\ndynamically selects and prioritizes download tasks from an evolving playlist,\nbalancing Quality of Experience (QoE) and bandwidth efficiency under practical\ncommercial constraints. However, real world analysis reveals critical\nlimitations of existing approaches: (1) insufficient adaptation of download\ntask sizes to dynamic conditions, and (2) watch time prediction models that are\ndifficult to deploy reliably at scale. In this paper, we propose DeLoad, a\nnovel preloading framework that addresses these issues by introducing dynamic\ntask sizing and a practical, multi dimensional watch time estimation method.\nAdditionally, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enhanced agent is trained to\noptimize the download range decisions adaptively. Extensive evaluations\nconducted on an offline testing platform, leveraging massive real world network\ndata, demonstrate that DeLoad achieves significant improvements in QoE metrics\n(34.4% to 87.4% gain). Furthermore, after deployment on a large scale\ncommercial short video platform, DeLoad has increased overall user watch time\nby 0.09% while simultaneously reducing rebuffering events and 3.76% bandwidth\nconsumption.",

      "abstract": "The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on\nthe quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored\nincorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a\nfundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of\nalignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate\nsemantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation\nby proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational\nAutoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's\nsemantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE\ndecoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution\nReconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially\ncoarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of\nrepresentation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed\nSE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows\nus to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically\naccelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training\nstrategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID\n(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).\nWith continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of\n1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.",

      "title": "Grounding or Guessing? Visual Signals for Detecting Hallucinations in Sign Language Translation",
      "abstract": "Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual\nevidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly\ncritical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise\ngrounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because\nthey map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without\nintermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that\nhallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual\ninput. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that\nquantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines\nfeature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is\nmasked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences\nbetween clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a\nsentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure\nof visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks\n(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our\nresults show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across\ndatasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond\nthese quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded\ntokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when\ncombined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it\nfurther improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights\nwhy gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together,\nour findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for\ndiagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust\nhallucination detection in multimodal generation.",

      "title": "Beyond Single Images: Retrieval Self-Augmented Unsupervised Camouflaged Object Detection",
      "abstract": "At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects\nfrom their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this\nchallenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based\noptimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly\ntaps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious\nannotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented\nparadigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels\nfor single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by\nconstructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using\ntraining images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)\nretrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It\nis important to recognize that using only training images without annotations\nexerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In\nthis light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where\ncoarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent\nhistogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce\nhigh-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect\nof artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which\nintegrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and\nprecise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/xiaohainku/RISE.",

Gaining insight into how these landscapes interact with\ngradient-based optimization methods, even in relatively simple models, can shed\nlight on this enigmatic feature of neural networks. In this work, we will focus\non a prototypical simple learning problem, which generalizes the Phase\nRetrieval inference problem by allowing the exploration of overparametrized\nsettings. Using techniques from field theory, we analyze the spectrum of the\nHessian at initialization and identify a Baik-Ben Arous-P\\'ech\\'e (BBP)\ntransition in the amount of data that separates regimes where the\ninitialization is informative or uninformative about a planted signal of a\nteacher-student setup. Crucially, we demonstrate how overparameterization can\nbend the loss landscape, shifting the transition point, even reaching the\ninformation-theoretic weak-recovery threshold in the large overparameterization\nlimit, while also altering its qualitative nature. We distinguish between\ncontinuous and discontinuous BBP transitions and support our analytical\npredictions with simulations, examining how they compare to the finite-N\nbehavior. In the case of discontinuous BBP transitions strong finite-N\ncorrections allow the retrieval of information at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nsmaller than the predicted BBP transition. In these cases we provide estimates\nfor a new lower SNR threshold that marks the point at which initialization\nbecomes entirely uninformative.",

Unlike\nconventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion\nwith negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained\nmodels. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.\nSpecifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers\ninto pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain\nparameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a\ncorresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential\nperformance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set\nof adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are\nimplemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of\nthe shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific\nfunction. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet\nenables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\\times$ depth-scaled\nDeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training\nfrom scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,\nhighlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs.

However, existing\nmonitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide\ntimely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban\nWaterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that\nautomatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates\nstructured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we\ndesign a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT)\nprompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for\ndata-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks\ndemonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based\nevaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual\nreports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact.\nThis dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception\nto generation, while the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models\nlays the groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems, supporting urban\nmanagement, disaster response and climate resilience.",

Self-validating\nthermocouples aim to address this issue by using a miniature phase-change cell\n(fixed-point) in close proximity to the measurement junction (tip) of the\nthermocouple. The fixed point is a crucible containing an ingot of metal with a\nknown melting temperature. When the process temperature being monitored passes\nthrough the melting temperature of the ingot, the thermocouple output exhibits\na \"plateau\" during melting. Since the melting temperature of the ingot is\nknown, the thermocouple can be recalibrated in situ. Identifying the melting\nplateau to determine the onset of melting is reasonably well established but\nrequires manual intervention involving zooming in on the region around the\nactual melting temperature, a process which can depend on the shape of the\nmelting plateau. For the first time, we present a novel machine learning\napproach to recognize and identify the characteristic shape of the melting\nplateau and once identified, to quantity the point at which melting begins,\nalong with its associated uncertainty. This removes the need for human\nintervention in locating and characterizing the melting point. Results from\ntest data provided by CCPI Europe show 100% accuracy of melting plateau\ndetection.

Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on\ndisruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the\narrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral\nstructures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent\nadvances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have\npartially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into\nhigher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.\nFurthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and\nexhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate\nthese issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method.

      "abstract": "The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine\nlearning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the\npossibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and\nmobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are\ncapable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was\ncreated to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the\ninference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and\ncheckpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa\nmodels, with the intention of extending future work to include models of\ndifferent modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's\ncapabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and\nmore accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are\nessential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape\nanalysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to\nintroduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the\nautomated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted\nMRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models\nwere reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes\nwere computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were\nderived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian\ncurvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was\napplied to these three features to create compact and informative feature\nvectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of\nclassifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:\nStatistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was\nevaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in\ndistinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an\naccuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the\nentropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and\nrobust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy\nunderscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of\nAlzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical\nresearch applications.",

      "abstract": "Distilling the tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into\nsmaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for\ntheir practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static\nset of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While\nreinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse\nrewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with\ninefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these\ndistinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically\ncombines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation,\nMENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through\nexploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a\nteacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided\nreward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and\nstrategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL\nbaselines.",

      "abstract": "Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing\nneural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These\nmethods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,\n(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned\nmodel. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by\nassigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with\nthe highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp\nlocal minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask\nselection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome\nthis issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed\nScore-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we\nintroduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates\nduring the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the\ncorresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,\nmodels, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes\nsharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately\nimproving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.",

      "abstract": "Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual\nevaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent\nsemantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly\nrely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of\na single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived\nrepresentations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal\nscene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various\ncomputer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.\nHowever, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the\ncontext of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which\nleverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance\nICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with\nsubjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a\ncomplexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The\ncomplexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the\nguidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic\nalignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that\nconvey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive\nexperiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

      "abstract": "Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for\ntransferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target\ngraph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the\nclosed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label\nspaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world\nscenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in\nthe source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised\nopen-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly\nclassify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously\nunseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel\nframework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and\nmodel sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph\nstructure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and\nunknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning\ndomain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while\npreserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.\nAdditionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown\nclass, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set\nrecognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate\nthat our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round\ninteraction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical\nin the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,\nno attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the\nclean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,\nvideo-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted\nfrom a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based\nmethods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query\nattack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient\napproach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that\nFeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\\% against traditional\nvideo classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of\nthe feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM\nrecognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit\nhigh quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the\nattack barely perceptible.

To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically\nneural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural\narchitecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow\nwithin a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the\nforward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However,\ndue to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are\nsignificantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler\nencoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose\nFGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains\nan encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model\nstructures.

However, they primarily focus on\npairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios\noften emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in\njoint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group\nview and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information\nin terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the\ngeometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters\nusing a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from\nbounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via\nself-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the\nsemantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction\ndecoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features.

This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a\nvoice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for\nBengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural\nhandbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the\ncontent; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic\nretrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system\nto receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali\nquery, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma\n3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the\nanswer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced\nhigh-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop\nmanagement, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the\nKisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on\na 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual\nrichness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable\nrelevance and technical specificity.

We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2\nusing a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report\npreliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These\nfindings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a\nsimple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.",

      "abstract": "Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize\nboth visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions\nabout audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient\nflexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality\npreference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on\nthe question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It\nenhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex\naudio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling\nboth temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce\na dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on\naudio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating\nredundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the\nmodality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each\nmodality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of\ncritical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to\nreinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality\ndimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal\ncollaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show\nthat AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in\ncomplex reasoning tasks.",

While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA)\nDSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context\nlearning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key\nchallenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to\nnoisy annotation.\n  In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation\nExtraction framework.

      "abstract": "Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing\nresearch interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection\nacross multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models\nfor distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources.\nUnder the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have\nbrought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they\ndirectly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors\nbetween normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to\ndistinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified\nfeature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations\nto address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we\ndesign a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features\ninto a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to\nprevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling\ncapability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a\nglobal perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.\nExtensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection\nbenchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)\nand one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a\nremarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four\ndatasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across\ndifferent scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Despite progress in watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs),\nreal-world deployment remains limited. We argue that this gap stems from\nmisaligned incentives among LLM providers, platforms, and end users, which\nmanifest as four key barriers: competitive risk, detection-tool governance,\nrobustness concerns and attribution issues. We revisit three classes of\nwatermarking through this lens. \\emph{Model watermarking} naturally aligns with\nLLM provider interests, yet faces new challenges in open-source ecosystems.\n\\emph{LLM text watermarking} offers modest provider benefit when framed solely\nas an anti-misuse tool, but can gain traction in narrowly scoped settings such\nas dataset de-contamination or user-controlled provenance. \\emph{In-context\nwatermarking} (ICW) is tailored for trusted parties, such as conference\norganizers or educators, who embed hidden watermarking instructions into\ndocuments. If a dishonest reviewer or student submits this text to an LLM, the\noutput carries a detectable watermark indicating misuse. This setup aligns\nincentives: users experience no quality loss, trusted parties gain a detection\ntool, and LLM providers remain neutral by simply following watermark\ninstructions. We advocate for a broader exploration of incentive-aligned\nmethods, with ICW as an example, in domains where trusted parties need reliable\ntools to detect misuse. More broadly, we distill design principles for\nincentive-aligned, domain-specific watermarking and outline future research\ndirections. Our position is that the practical adoption of LLM watermarking\nrequires aligning stakeholder incentives in targeted application domains and\nfostering active community engagement.",

We refer to a parametrisation\n  of this property of a given training set, as its ``inhomogeneity\n  parameter''. It is easy to compute this parameter for small-to-large\n  datasets, and we demonstrate such computation on multiple\n  publicly-available datasets, while also demonstrating that\n  conventional ``non-stationarity'' of data does not imply a non-zero\n  inhomogeneity parameter of the dataset. We prove that - within the\n  probabilistic Gaussian Process-based learning approach - a training\n  set with a non-zero inhomogeneity parameter renders it imperative,\n  that the process that is invoked to model the sought function, be\n  non-stationary. Following the learning of a real-world multivariate\n  function with such a Process, quality and reliability of predictions\n  at test inputs, are demonstrated to be affected by the inhomogeneity\n  parameter of the training data.",

      "abstract": "We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for\nsemi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow\nmatching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields\nbetween probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to\ndiffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly\napplying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea\n-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the\nframework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed\ntarget (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key\nadvantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the\nneed for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;\n(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which\nquantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward\npass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models\nsuch as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy\nbut heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as\nthe learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly\nscore inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is\nLipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical\nguarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench\nbenchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy\nand inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on\nhigh-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

      "abstract": "The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates\nadvanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical\nphotographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient\ncomputational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become\ncrucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in\ndisaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data\nfrom the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality\ndisaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data\nscarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets\nlacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.\nMoreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class\nsimilarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based\nBhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which\nlinearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to\ncompare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype\nformation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that\nenhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes\nsame-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but\noperates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.\nFurthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is\nproposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used\njointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL\nperformance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets\ndemonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net\ncompared to existing approaches.",

      "abstract": "Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven\neffective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and\ntime-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile\nmanipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two\nhigh-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have\naddressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations\nin simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key\nchallenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2)\npositioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor\npolicies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data\ngeneration as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints\n(e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during\nnavigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a\nprincipled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four\nmulti-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates\nsignificantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this\ndiversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a\nsingle source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few\nas 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic\nhardware.

We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry\nobjectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields\nthree practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored\nSoft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed\nnoise.

      "abstract": "As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly automate complex web tasks,\nthey boost productivity while simultaneously introducing new security risks.\nHowever, relevant studies on web agent attacks remain limited. Existing\nred-teaming approaches mainly rely on manually crafted attack strategies or\nstatic models trained offline. Such methods fail to capture the underlying\nbehavioral patterns of web agents, making it difficult to generalize across\ndiverse environments. In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous\ndiscovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis,\na novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and\nStrategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the\ngenetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates\nthe target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist\ndynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles\nthem into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to\nenhance the Attacker's effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various web\ntasks show that our framework discovers novel strategies and consistently\noutperforms existing attack baselines.",

Existing models, however, are\ntypically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,\nimprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we\nintroduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that\naddresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM\njointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D\noccupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon\nauto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic\nPlucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level\nsignals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video\ngeneration. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with\nexternal image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to\ndirectly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,\nwhile providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through\noccupancy-grounded rewards.

However, existing temporal causal representation learning\nmethods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint\ndistribution of hierarchical latent variables from \\textit{single-timestep\nobserved variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of\nhierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three\nconditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a\nCausally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our\napproach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the\njoint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit\nthe natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to\nidentify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,\nwe develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.\nThis model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent\nvariables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the\nindependent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical\nevaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical\nclaims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical\nlatent dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical\nscans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely\nsolely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated\nreasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their\ntraining scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmethods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during\nreasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual\ninformation during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first\nMultimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively\nretrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific\nmedical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage\nreinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model\nto leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information\nfor effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a\nConfidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when\nlow prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical\nbenchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline\nmodels, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with\nexternal knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable\ngeneralizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on\nour proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of\nechocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will\nbe made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.",

      "abstract": "In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are\ncrucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional\nspace is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the\noptimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms\nrequire a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing\nworks propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on\nunimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.\nHowever, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)\nin practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal\nbeams.\n  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms\n\\textit{pretc} and \\textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property\nof mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to\nthe Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each\npath as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled\nhistorical rewards. \\textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and\nthen commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.\n\\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the\nbest beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to\nbeam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the\nsynthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we\ndemonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range\nof scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their\ngeneralizability and robustness.",

      "title": "From Retrieval to Generation: Unifying External and Parametric Knowledge for Medical Question Answering",
      "abstract": "Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific\nknowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)\nwith external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge\nstored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two\ncategories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning\non externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG),\nwhich depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual\ndocuments. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while\nGAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to\nunconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine\nanswer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified\nretrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external\nand parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules:\nKnowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to\nproduce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by\nretrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively\nselects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form\nconcise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments\non five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5%\nimprovement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the\neffectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive\nreasoning.

      "abstract": "Food insecurity remains a persistent public health emergency in the United\nStates, tightly interwoven with chronic disease, mental illness, and opioid\nmisuse. Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries,\naccess remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static\ndirectories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and\ngeographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague\nnutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as\ntime, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems\noptimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of\nfood-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified\navailability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most\nvulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital\nilliteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we\nintroduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for\nreal-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three\ninnovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases,\ncommunity platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of\nfood resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on\ncurated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional\ncorrectness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval\npolicies to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic\nanalysis, and decision support, Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated and\nguidance at the point of need. This framework establishes an urgent step toward\nscalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations\nfacing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.",

Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic\nediting of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in\nGANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of\nattributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view\nconsistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D\nportrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents\na trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing\nin high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints\nin editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to\nphotorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on\nrecent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing\ntechniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing\nfor 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that\nusing just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to\nestimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware\nattribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with\nmasks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for\nestimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits,\nwe investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use\nthe (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a\ncontinuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.\nCode and results are available at: https://vishal-vinod.github.io/gmpi-edit/",

      "abstract": "In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the\nFederated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related\nto privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated\nlearning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation\nacross clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)\nproblem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This\nmotivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in\nfederated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,\nwe propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting\nfrom the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a\nhierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology\nto suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a\nparameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces\nmixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness\nagainst drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy\nduring model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and\npersonalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature\nsimilarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the\ntree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the\nadvantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two\npublicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method\noutperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these\nchallenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.",

      "abstract": "High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where\nquality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures\nbroad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically\nrely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly\nselecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a\nbroader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity\nbetween dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental\nbias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored\ndata to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We\nargue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into\northogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly\nselected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection\n(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data\nselection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering\nlanguage quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The\nmulti-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a\nRoberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,\nenabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the\ntraining dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,\nthereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that\nODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming\northogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with\nODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream\nbenchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data\nselection for LLMs.",

To address these\nissues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent\ninformation and low dimensional learning.

In the second stage,\nwith the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction\nlearning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing\nthe pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction\nmethods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through\ndimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces\ncomputational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy.

We present the first systematic theoretical study of this\nfundamental question, analyzing finite-step stochastic gradient descent (SGD)\nfor high-dimensional linear regression under a comprehensive range of\nquantization targets: data, labels, parameters, activations, and gradients. Our\nnovel analytical framework establishes precise algorithm-dependent and\ndata-dependent excess risk bounds that characterize how different quantization\naffects learning: parameter, activation, and gradient quantization amplify\nnoise during training; data quantization distorts the data spectrum; and data\nand label quantization introduce additional approximation and quantized error.\nCrucially, we prove that for multiplicative quantization (with input-dependent\nquantization step), this spectral distortion can be eliminated, and for\nadditive quantization (with constant quantization step), a beneficial scaling\neffect with batch size emerges. Furthermore, for common polynomial-decay data\nspectra, we quantitatively compare the risks of multiplicative and additive\nquantization, drawing a parallel to the comparison between FP and integer\nquantization methods. Our theory provides a powerful lens to characterize how\nquantization shapes the learning dynamics of optimization algorithms, paving\nthe way to further explore learning theory under practical hardware\nconstraints.",

      "abstract": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks\nsimultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced\ngeneralization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,\ntask imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the\nconvergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this\nissue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training\ndynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL\nsystem. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by\nleveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,\nNTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt\nspectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby\nmitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared\nrepresentation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency\nwhile maintaining competitive performance.

      "abstract": "Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for\nanalyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19\npandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short\ntexts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing\nincoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To\naddress these challenges, we have developed \\emph{TM-Rephrase}, a\nmodel-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to\nrephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic\nmodeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we\ninvestigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and\ncolloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results\ndemonstrate that \\emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic\nmodeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic\ndiversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,\nwith the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains\nand especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm.

Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been\nproved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets\n(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space\noptimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior\ninformation to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information\nrespectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.\nThen, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human\nmesh.

Prior work\non closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make\n'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We\ntherefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is\nopen-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce\nvalid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.\nFirst-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean\n$\\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\\approx$ 1).\nCrucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of\nconstraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production\nof a valid item rather than error detection and principled,\nconstraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection\ndeteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning'\nshow no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks\nfunctional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans\nrespect constraints even on a first pass.

      "abstract": "Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications\nlike autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain\ngap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR\nscans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on\nsynthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only\non real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.\n  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this\nsynthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.\nWe first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level\ntriplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined\ndirectly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core\ncontribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the\nmodel in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting\nit to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.\n  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing\nas few as 1.5\\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot\naccuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\\%. Consequently, our final model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like\nnuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\\% on\nnuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic\nbenchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not\nfull-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust\nopen-vocabulary 3D perception.

      "abstract": "Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities\nacross heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is\ndescribed by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically\nassume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,\nwhich is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert\nannotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet\nunder-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).\nDNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and\ninter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address\nthe DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first\nestimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences\nvia a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,\nRULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute\nfusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during\ninter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE\nfurther incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the\nunderlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more\naccurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five\nbenchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with\nseven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at\n\\href{https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/RULE}{XLearning-SCU/RULE}",

While promising, transformers' computational cost\nscales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number\nof candidates.

Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces\ncomputational complexity.

Second, a linear attention mechanism, \\textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the\ncomplexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to\nlinear ($O(N)$).\n  Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity\nwith state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\\times$ inference speedup on\nlarge candidate sets or long sequence lengths.

At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized\ndecision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,\nand a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically\nadjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.\nUnder the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target\ndetection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both\nenergy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered\nsystem, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,\ntheoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure\noperation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for\nthe execution of underwater covert communication tasks.",

A primary\nchallenge is the precise and fast auto-verification of whether the user follows\nMR guidance by comparing frames before and after each operation.

Existing approaches fall short of\naccounting for the discrepancies between physical and virtual objects due to\nimperfect 3D modeling or lighting estimation. In this paper, we propose EVER:\nan edge-assisted auto-verification system for mobile MR-aided operations.\nUnlike traditional frame-based similarity comparisons, EVER leverages the\nsegmentation model and rendering pipeline adapted to the unique attributes of\nframes with physical pieces and those with their virtual counterparts; it\nadopts a threshold-based strategy using Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics\nfor accurate auto-verification. To ensure fast auto-verification and low energy\nconsumption, EVER offloads compute-intensive tasks to an edge server. Through\ncomprehensive evaluations of public datasets and custom datasets with practical\nimplementation, EVER achieves over 90% verification accuracy within 100\nmilliseconds (significantly faster than average human reaction time of\napproximately 273 milliseconds), while consuming only minimal additional\ncomputational resources and energy compared to a system without\nauto-verification.",

      "abstract": "We explore how physical scale and population size shape the emergence of\ncomplex behaviors in open-ended ecological environments. In our setting, agents\nare unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but\ninstead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and natural\nselection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population\naround them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single\nhigh-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve\nacross large populations due to natural competition and environmental\npressures. In an effort to discover how complex behaviors naturally emerge, we\nconduct experiments in large-scale worlds that reach populations of more than\n60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We\nidentify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction,\nvision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival\npressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the\nemergence of these behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently\nlarge environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral\nstability and consistency. While there is a rich history of research in\nevolutionary settings, our scaling results provide promising new directions to\nexplore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of abundant\ncomputational resources.

      "abstract": "Deep hashing converts high-dimensional feature vectors into compact binary\ncodes, enabling efficient large-scale retrieval. A fundamental challenge in\ndeep hashing stems from the discrete nature of quantization in generating the\ncodes. W-type regularizations, such as $||z|-1|$, have been proven effective as\nthey encourage variables toward binary values. However, existing methods often\ndirectly optimize these regularizations without convergence guarantees. While\nproximal gradient methods offer a promising solution, the coupling between\nW-type regularizers and neural network outputs results in composite forms that\ngenerally lack closed-form proximal solutions. In this paper, we present a\nstochastic primal-dual hashing algorithm, referred to as DualHash, that\nprovides rigorous complexity bounds. Using Fenchel duality, we partially\ntransform the nonconvex W-type regularization optimization into the dual space,\nwhich results in a proximal operator that admits closed-form solutions. We\nderive two algorithm instances: a momentum-accelerated version with\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-4})$ complexity and an improved\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-3})$ version using variance reduction.

By\nleveraging tools from contiguity theory in statistics, we show that there is a\nbias-variance tradeoff between SAA, IEO, and ETO under local misspecification,\nand that the relative importance of the bias and the variance depends on the\ndegree of local misspecification.

We\npresent Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework\nto systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity\nclassification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.\nUsing a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we\nconstruct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.\nOur evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint\nunderstanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear\nunimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when\njoint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most\ncritically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur\ndespite correct classification of the individual modalities, further\ndemonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we\nfind that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still\nresponding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find\nthat instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline\ncontent from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of\nunder-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to\n53.9%.

      "abstract": "Despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still generate\nvulnerable code. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to\nenhance LLMs for secure code generation by incorporating external security\nknowledge. However, the conventional RAG design struggles with the noise of raw\nsecurity-related documents, and existing retrieval methods overlook the\nsignificant security semantics implicitly embedded in task descriptions. To\naddress these issues, we propose RESCUE, a new RAG framework for secure code\ngeneration with two key innovations. First, we propose a hybrid knowledge base\nconstruction method that combines LLM-assisted cluster-then-summarize\ndistillation with program slicing, producing both high-level security\nguidelines and concise, security-focused code examples. Second, we design a\nhierarchical multi-faceted retrieval to traverse the constructed knowledge base\nfrom top to bottom and integrates multiple security-critical facts at each\nhierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive and accurate retrieval. We evaluated\nRESCUE on four benchmarks and compared it with five state-of-the-art secure\ncode generation methods on six LLMs. The results demonstrate that RESCUE\nimproves the SecurePass@1 metric by an average of 4.8 points, establishing a\nnew state-of-the-art performance for security. Furthermore, we performed\nin-depth analysis and ablation studies to rigorously validate the effectiveness\nof individual components in RESCUE.",

Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large\nlanguage models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D\nmulti-objective optimization (MOO) problem.

      "abstract": "Global illumination (GI) is essential for realistic rendering but remains\ncomputationally expensive due to the complexity of simulating indirect light\ntransport. Recent neural methods have mainly relied on per-scene optimization,\nsometimes extended to handle changes in camera or geometry. Efforts toward\ncross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as\nneural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view\ninconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D\nlight transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from\n3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each\nscene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A\nscalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these\nfeatures into neural primitives. At render time, each query point retrieves\nnearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregates their latent\nfeatures through cross-attention to predict the desired rendering quantity. We\ndemonstrate results on diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse\nindoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding\ntrained for irradiance estimation can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks\nwith limited fine-tuning. We also present preliminary results for\nspatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and show how\nthe normalized field can accelerate unbiased path guiding. This approach\nhighlights a path toward integrating learned priors into rendering pipelines\nwithout explicit ray-traced illumination cues.",

      "abstract": "Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe\ninter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns.\nExisting approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack\ninterpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce\nVelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense\noptical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering\ncategorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,\nand fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations\nfrom learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nframework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within\ndensely crowded environments.",

      "title": "ActivationReasoning: Logical Reasoning in Latent Activation Spaces",
      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their\ninternal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features\nthat often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and\npassive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To\naddress this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds\nexplicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three\nstages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept\nrepresentations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a\ndictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects\nactivating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical\nreasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order\nstructures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on\nmulti-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept\ncues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),\nand context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales\nrobustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and\ncontext-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results\ndemonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only\nimproves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,\nand alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and\nauditable AI.",

Current\ndetectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or\nGPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,\noften with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.\nTo address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small\nLanguage Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and\nCodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language\nto prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a\nhuge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=\n0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by\n$8$-$12\\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\\times$ at $512$-token inputs.

      "abstract": "Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central\nchallenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based\nmethods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized\nequilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to\napproximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.\nInstead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and\nachieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main\ntheoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic\nimprovement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum\ngames, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,\nwe develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which\npreserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely\non the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable\nor lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark\ngames and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas\nHold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.",
