  "note": "Found 6 mineable channels with verified examples. Challenge: The specific combination of criteria (recent design school grad + SVG animation expertise + AI/vibe coding interest + active in creative communities) is very niche. Most motion designers from SVA/Parsons focus on traditional animation rather than web-based SVG work. Recommend broadening to include adjacent skills or looking at web developers with motion design interest.",
