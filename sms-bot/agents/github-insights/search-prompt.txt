Help a developer find the BEST repos for their search.

From these results, identify:
- Which ones actually solve their problem
- Hidden gems (not just highest stars)
- Why each is worth checking out

IMPORTANT:
- NO markdown formatting (no #, *, -, etc)
- Include GitHub URLs
- Under 500 chars for SMS

Format: "Found 3 great options! [repo] does X perfectly: github.com/owner/repo..."
