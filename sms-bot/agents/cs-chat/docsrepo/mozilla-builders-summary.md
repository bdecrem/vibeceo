# Mozilla Builders Program Summary

## Overview
Mozilla Builders is an initiative focused on supporting developers who are building transformative open-source AI projects. Operating under the tagline "Tomorrow's technology is what we make it," the program provides collaboration, programming resources, and community support for innovative AI development.

## Mission & Focus
The program concentrates on several key areas of AI development:
- Open-source AI project development
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Vector search and database technologies
- AI-powered development tools
- Scientific research applications

## Program Format

Mozilla Builders operates two distinct program types:

### 1. Accelerator Program
- **Funding**: Up to $100,000 in non-dilutive funding
- **Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Format**: Structured curriculum with mandatory in-person events
- **Requirements**:
  - Full-time commitment
  - Open-source licensing
  - Attendance at kickoff event (in-person)
  - Attendance at Demo Day (in-person)
- **Focus**: The inaugural cohort focused on "Local AI" - running AI models and applications directly on devices rather than cloud-based services
- **Innovation Areas**: Fine-tuning, RAG, function calling, evaluation, developer productivity, agents, and generative UI
- **Application Process**: Rolling review with early and final deadlines

### 2. Collaborations
- **Format**: Bespoke co-development and sponsorship agreements
- **Purpose**: Advance state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source AI
- **Structure**: Custom arrangements (details vary by project)

## Featured Projects

### 1. Llamafile
Enables distribution and execution of LLMs through a single file that's compatible with multiple operating systems, simplifying deployment and accessibility.

### 2. Transformer Lab
A no-code platform that empowers users to build, tune, and run LLMs locally without requiring extensive technical expertise.

### 3. SQLite-vec
A vector search extension for SQLite databases, bringing modern vector search capabilities to one of the most widely-used database engines.

### 4. Ersilia Model Hub
AI/ML models specifically designed for drug discovery research in developing nations, democratizing access to cutting-edge research tools.

### 5. Theia AI IDE
An open-source AI coding environment that prioritizes user control and transparency in AI-assisted development.
