# Nevo Labs - Israeli Science & Innovation Research Institute

**Website**: https://www.nevolabs.com
**Status**: Pre-launch (fundraising phase as of February 2025)
**Target Funding**: $800 million
**Founder**: Sender Cohen, Managing Partner of KH2 Capital

**Offices**:
- New York: 205 Hudson Street, New York, NY 10013 (nyc@nevolabs.com)
- Tel Aviv: 46 Montefiore Street, Tel Aviv 6520118 (tlv@nevolabs.com)

**Mission**: "A New Era for Israeli Science and Innovation" - Creating a Bell Labs-style commercial research institute to solve Israel's brain drain and enable long-term breakthrough technology development

## Overview

Nevo Labs is an ambitious initiative to establish a commercial science and innovation research laboratory in Israel, modeled after AT&T's legendary Bell Labs. The institute aims to raise $800 million to create a world-class research facility focused on long-term (5-15 year) commercial development in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and synthetic biology.

The initiative directly addresses Israel's critical brain drain problem: "Nine out of every ten doctoral students do their postdoc in the US" and most never return due to limited domestic research opportunities. While Israel excels at near-term technological solutions (1-2 years) driven by military and cybersecurity needs, the country "has not been great" at developing technologies needed five to fifteen years forward.

Nevo Labs represents a private-sector response to this gap, creating an environment where Israeli scientists and engineers can pursue breakthrough research without leaving the country. The model draws inspiration from three successful institutions:
- **Bell Labs** (AT&T's "America's idea factory")
- **TII Abu Dhabi** (Technology Innovation Institute - developed Falcon language model)
- **Arena BioWorks Boston** (Harvard-based commercialization institute)

This is structured as a "private sovereign research fund" - not linked to the Israeli state, though government capital could potentially be added if interested.

## The Problem: Israel's Brain Drain Crisis

### The Challenge

**Current situation**:
- **9 out of 10** Israeli doctoral students do their postdoc in the US
- Most never return to Israel due to lack of comparable opportunities
- Limited academic positions in Israel
- No commercial research institutions for long-term development
- Israeli researchers caught in impossible choice: pursue world-class research (abroad) or return home (limited opportunities)

**Israel's research gap**:
- **Strong at**: 1-2 year technological solutions (military, cybersecurity)
- **Weak at**: 5-15 year breakthrough technology development
- **Result**: Talent exodus, lost innovation potential, economic opportunity costs

### The Solution: Nevo Labs Model

**What Nevo Labs provides**:
1. **Career pathway**: Israeli PhDs can stay/return home for world-class research
2. **Long-term focus**: 5-15 year timelines (vs. near-term military applications)
3. **Commercial research**: Between pure academia and startup pressures
4. **Resources**: Infrastructure, equipment, funding comparable to US institutions
5. **Interdisciplinary environment**: Collaboration across AI, quantum, synthetic biology
6. **Competitive compensation**: Retain talent that would otherwise emigrate

## Key Projects & Research Strategy

### Bell Labs Inspiration

Nevo Labs explicitly models itself on **AT&T Bell Labs**, often called "America's idea factory," which produced:
- The transistor (Nobel Prize)
- Information theory (Claude Shannon)
- Unix operating system
- C programming language
- Laser technology
- Countless other breakthroughs

**Bell Labs success factors** Nevo Labs aims to replicate:
- Patient capital (long-term funding)
- World-class talent concentration
- Interdisciplinary collaboration
- Freedom to pursue fundamental research
- Commercial application pathways
- "Luxury of time" without short-term pressure

### TII Abu Dhabi Model

**Technology Innovation Institute (Abu Dhabi)** provides contemporary example:
- Hundreds of millions invested by UAE government
- Developed **Falcon language model** (open-source LLM competing with GPT)
- Demonstrates Gulf region's commitment to long-term research
- Proves viability of sovereign research fund model

### Arena BioWorks Model

**Arena BioWorks (Boston/Harvard)** shows commercialization pathway:
- Identifies disease cure commercialization opportunities
- Bridges fundamental research and commercial application

## Funding Philosophy & Strategic Vision

### Patient Capital Approach

Nevo Labs represents recognition that breakthrough innovation requires:
1. **Long time horizons**: 5-15 years, not quarters or fiscal years
2. **Risk tolerance**: Many research paths fail; that's expected
3. **Interdisciplinary freedom**: Let scientists follow interesting connections
4. **Resource adequacy**: "Right tools, right systems, right resources"
5. **Talent retention**: Competitive with global opportunities

### Connection to Other Innovation Models

Similar to other case studies in this repository:
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: 40-year timeline from DARPA to Waymo required patient government then corporate capital
- **Transformers/LLMs**: 35+ years of government-funded basic research (NSF, CIFAR) before corporate commercialization
- **AI2050**: Schmidt's $125M recognizing need for long-term AI research
- **Humanity AI**: $500M coalition ensuring AI serves people
- **Bell Labs**: Original model of patient capital + breakthrough science

### The "Missing Middle" Problem

**Research funding landscape**:
- **Academic grants**: 2-5 year projects, publication-focused, limited budgets
- **Venture capital**: 2-3 year exits, product-market fit pressure, short timelines
- **Corporate R&D**: Quarterly earnings pressure, applied research focus
- **Government basic research**: Long-term but academic, not commercial

**Nevo Labs targets the gap**: 5-15 year commercial breakthrough research
- Too long for VCs
- Too commercial for pure academia
- Too risky for quarterly-focused corporations
- Exactly the Bell Labs model that produced 20th century breakthroughs

### Israeli Strategic Imperative

**Why Israel needs Nevo Labs**:
1. **Talent retention**: Stop losing 90% of PhD talent to US
2. **Economic competitiveness**: Breakthrough tech = future industries
3. **Strategic autonomy**: Critical technologies developed domestically
4. **Ecosystem completion**: Startups + VCs + universities + **long-term research**
5. **Regional leadership**: Compete with Gulf states' science investments

**What success looks like** (15-20 years):
- Nobel Prizes from Nevo Labs research
- Breakthrough technologies commercialized in Israel
- Israeli PhDs choosing domestic research over US emigration
- Startup ecosystem built on Nevo Labs IP
- International scientists seeking Nevo Labs positions
- Regional science hub (Israel + Gulf collaboration)
