# Mozilla Fix-the-Internet Incubator (2020)

**Program Duration**: 2020 (experimental, time-limited)
**Leadership**: Bart Decrem, Head of Mozilla Studio
**Total Investment**: 80+ projects funded across all programs
**Website (Archived)**: https://builders.mozilla.community/old/

**Tagline**: "We're Fixing the Internet. Join Us."

## Overview

Mozilla Fix-the-Internet Incubator was an experimental startup program launched in 2020 to support developers, startups, and technology enthusiasts building projects that would reshape the internet and have a positive impact. The program represented Mozilla's first major foray into incubator/accelerator territory, moving beyond grants and prizes to direct startup investments.

The initiative was born during a critical moment: early 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic was forcing the world online and exposing fundamental problems with internet infrastructure, privacy, harassment, misinformation, and digital equity. Mozilla saw an opportunity to catalyze a new generation of internet-fixing entrepreneurs.

**Core thesis**: The internet needs fixing, and the best way to fix it is to fund and support builders creating alternatives to exploitative business models, surveillance capitalism, centralized platforms, and closed ecosystems.

## Program Structure: Three-Tier Model

Mozilla Builders evolved from a single Spring MVP Lab (April 2020) into a comprehensive three-tier incubator structure by summer 2020:

## Strategic Context: Why Mozilla Did This

### Mozilla's 2020 Position

**Challenges**:
- **Revenue pressure**: Google search deal under antitrust scrutiny
- **Browser market share declining**: Chrome dominance growing
- **Mission relevance**: How to stay relevant to "fix internet" mission?
- **Talent retention**: Competing with Big Tech for top talent
- **Innovation pipeline**: How to incubate new ideas beyond browser?

**Opportunities**:
- **COVID-19 moment**: Internet's problems exposed by pandemic
- **Brand strength**: Mozilla still respected for open web advocacy
- **Network**: Deep connections in tech community
- **Resources**: Ability to fund experimental initiatives
- **Urgency**: 2020 felt like critical moment for internet's direction

### The Incubator as Strategic Bet

**Thesis**:
- Mozilla can't fix internet alone through Firefox
- Need ecosystem of internet-fixing startups
- Mozilla's brand/resources can catalyze this ecosystem
- Small investments ($75k) can make big difference for early startups
- Portfolio approach hedges bets across multiple solutions

**Goals**:
1. **Mission impact**: Get more internet-fixing projects built
2. **Ecosystem building**: Create network of aligned founders
3. **Talent pipeline**: Connect with next generation of mission-driven builders
4. **Learning**: Understand startup landscape, what works
5. **Relevance**: Position Mozilla as innovation leader, not just browser company
6. **Optionality**: Some investments might succeed and vindicate approach

**Risks**:
- **Distraction**: Takes resources from core browser work
- **Capability**: Mozilla lacks VC expertise
- **Dilution**: Spreading resources across 80 projects may limit impact
- **Failure**: Most startups fail; portfolio could disappoint
- **Reputation**: Failed investments could damage Mozilla brand

### Outcomes Against Strategic Goals

**Mission impact**: ✓ Partial success
- 80+ projects built, some with real impact (Ameelio, privacy tools)
- But most didn't scale to change internet landscape
- Incremental progress, not transformation

**Ecosystem building**: ✓ Success
- Created network of 300+ internet-fixing founders
- Alumni still reference Mozilla Builders participation
- Demonstrated that mission-driven startups can raise capital

**Talent pipeline**: ✓ Success
- Connected Mozilla to emerging founders
- Some founders later joined Mozilla or related orgs
- Strengthened Mozilla's reputation among builders

**Learning**: ✓ Success
- Learned that startup investing requires different model than grants
- Informed future Mozilla Ventures structure (2022)
- Validated some hypotheses (privacy tools can scale), invalidated others

**Relevance**: ✓ Success
- Positioned Mozilla as innovation leader
- Generated positive media coverage (TechCrunch, etc.)
- Showed Mozilla as active, not just legacy browser company

**Optionality**: ✗ Limited success
- No breakout successes that validated $75k investments
- Unstoppable Domains grew, but unclear if Mozilla investment was critical
- Portfolio didn't produce returns (but wasn't primarily goal)

## Lessons for Future Incubators

### What Mozilla Got Right

**1. Low barrier to entry (Open Lab)**
- 300 teams participated vs. 25 funded
- Built community and funnel
- Enabled experimentation without commitment

**2. Multiple funding tiers**
- Served different stages: exploration → MVP → scaling
- Founders could progress through tiers
- Different risk/reward profiles

**3. Mission-driven thesis**
- "Fix-the-Internet" attracted aligned founders
- Clear values helped with selection
- Differentiated from generic accelerators

**4. Non-dilutive options**
- MVP Lab grants attracted founders who'd reject equity deals
- Faster, simpler than SAFE negotiations
- More accessible to first-time founders

**5. Global reach**
- Applications from 40+ countries
- Solutions to problems Mozilla HQ might not see
- Diverse perspectives on "fixing internet"

**6. Community first**
- Discord, peer feedback, collaboration
- More than just funding
- Alumni network continues post-program

### What Was Challenging

**1. Too many companies for deep support**
- 80+ companies is venture studio scale
- Hard to provide meaningful help to all
- Some teams felt under-supported

**2. 8 weeks is very short**
- Barely enough time to build MVP
- Not enough for real traction
- Rushed showcase preparation

**3. Unclear follow-on funding path**
- Mozilla didn't have $500k-2M follow-on fund
- Teams struggled to raise after program
- No built-in investor demo day initially

**4. Equity investments complex for nonprofit**
- Mozilla Foundation is nonprofit
- Equity investing creates complications
- Better suited to separate VC fund (later: Mozilla Ventures)

**5. Selection criteria subjective**
- "Fix-the-Internet" is broad
- Hard to compare prison telecom vs. DNS privacy
- Some selections felt random to applicants

**6. Limited technical depth**
- Program team couldn't provide deep technical mentorship across all domains
- Relied on external experts
- Mozilla's expertise (browsers) didn't always transfer

### Recommendations for Similar Programs

**If replicating Mozilla's model**:

1. **Pick 25-30 companies max**: Better to go deep than broad
2. **Make it 12+ weeks**: 8 weeks too rushed for meaningful progress
3. **Build investor network early**: Demo Day needs qualified investors attending
4. **Separate equity from grants**: Use separate entities if doing both
5. **Hire domain experts**: Can't generalize across all "fix internet" problems
6. **Create follow-on fund**: Or partner with VCs for $500k-2M next round
7. **Track outcomes rigorously**: Impact metrics, continuation rates, funding raised
8. **Keep community alive**: Alumni network is valuable, maintain it
9. **In-person > virtual**: (COVID forced virtual, but in-person builds stronger bonds)
10. **Narrow the thesis**: "Fix internet" too broad; "Local AI" (2024) more focused

**Alternative models to consider**:
- **Longer fellowship model** (6-12 months) with smaller cohorts (10-15)
- **Open-source bounties** instead of equity/grants
- **Resident program** (bring founders to Mozilla HQ)
- **Partnership with established accelerator** (co-branded YC batch?)
- **Thesis-driven fund** (just privacy tools, or just decentralization)

**About the Internet's Problems**:
- Many founders want to fix internet, need support
- Privacy tools, decentralization, user-control all have product-market fit
- Regulatory capture (prison telecoms) vulnerable to disruption
- Open-source can compete with surveillance capitalism
- Global problem requires global solutions

**About Startup Funding**:
- Mission-driven founders exist and are fundable
- Non-dilutive capital (grants) attracts different founders than equity
- 8 weeks too short for real startup progress
- Community matters as much as capital
- Portfolio approach requires expertise and ongoing support

**About Mozilla**:
- Mozilla's brand still powerful for attracting mission-driven builders
- Startup investing is different skillset from Mozilla's core competencies
- Experimentation and time-limited initiatives are viable
- Mozilla's future may be as ecosystem convener, not just product company

### The 2020 Moment

**Context matters**:
- COVID-19 pandemic
- 2020 US election and misinformation crisis
- Racial justice protests coordinated on social media
- Privacy scandals and antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech
- Sense that internet at inflection point

**Fix-the-Internet felt urgent in 2020**:
- Internet's problems exposed by pandemic (digital divide, misinformation, surveillance)
- Moment of possibility for alternatives
- Founders eager to build solutions
- Funders willing to back mission-driven startups

**Did it work?**
- Yes: Funded 80+ projects, created community, some real impact
- No: Internet not "fixed", Big Tech still dominant, most projects didn't scale
- **Maybe**: Seeds planted may grow over decades; too early to judge ultimate impact

### Looking Forward: The Internet Still Needs Fixing

**The problems persist** (2025):
- Surveillance capitalism still dominant business model
- Platform monopolies stronger than ever
- Misinformation, harassment, exploitation continue
- Centralization increasing (AI models, cloud infrastructure)
- User agency and privacy still under threat

**New problems emerged**:
- Generative AI and copyright/attribution
- Social media mental health impacts
- Algorithmic amplification of extremism
- Climate impact of compute-intensive AI
- AI safety and alignment

**The need for "fix-the-internet" programs remains**:
- 2024 Mozilla Builders Accelerator (Local AI focus)
- Mozilla Ventures ($35M fund)
- Other "responsible tech" / "ethical AI" initiatives
- Growing ecosystem of mission-driven founders and funders

**Mozilla's 2020 incubator may have been early**, but it was directionally correct: the internet needs fixing, and supporting builders with aligned values is one way to catalyze change. The experimental program ended, but the mission continues.
