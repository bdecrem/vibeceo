## PAGE 1: PROGRAM OVERVIEW & MISSION

### The Mission: Building AI That Serves Humanity

The AI Builders program supports developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs building transformative AI projects that prioritize human agency, transparency, and equitable access. We're creating the next generation of AI tools and infrastructure that challenge extractive business models and centralized control.

**Core Thesis**: AI development is at a critical inflection point. The decisions made today about who controls AI, how it's deployed, and whose values it embodies will shape society for decades. We fund builders creating alternatives to surveillance-driven AI, democratizing access to powerful models, and ensuring AI serves humanity broadly—not just Big Tech shareholders.

### What We Fund

**Focus Areas:**
- **Open-source AI development** - Models, tools, and infrastructure accessible to all
- **On-device & local AI** - Running powerful AI without cloud dependency or data extraction
- **AI safety & alignment tools** - Making AI systems more interpretable, controllable, and trustworthy
- **Democratized AI access** - Bringing AI capabilities to underserved communities and use cases
- **Responsible AI infrastructure** - Privacy-preserving ML, federated learning, decentralized compute
- **AI for social good** - Applications in education, healthcare, climate, accessibility

### Our Values

**Builder-First Philosophy:**
- **Transparency over black boxes** - Open weights, interpretable systems, explainable outputs
- **User agency over extraction** - Users control their data and how AI learns from it
- **Decentralization where it matters** - Alternatives to platform monopolies
- **Sustainable business models** - Beyond surveillance capitalism
- **Global access** - AI tools that work for everyone, not just resource-rich institutions
- **Community-driven development** - Open-source collaboration, not proprietary moats
