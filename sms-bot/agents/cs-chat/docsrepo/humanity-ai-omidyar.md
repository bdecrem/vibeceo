# Humanity AI - Omidyar Network & Coalition

**Website**: https://www.humanityai.ai
**Announcement**: October 2025
**Total Funding**: $500 million over 5 years
**Co-Chairs**: Omidyar Network & John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation

**Mission**: "AI is not destiny, it is design." — Michele L. Jawando, President, Omidyar Network

## Overview

Humanity AI is a $500 million, five-year philanthropic initiative launched in October 2025 by a coalition of 10 major foundations. The program aims to ensure that communities beyond Silicon Valley have real influence over artificial intelligence's development and impact on society.

Unlike corporate AI initiatives focused primarily on technical capabilities and market opportunities, Humanity AI takes a people-centered approach. The coalition seeks to shift decision-making power away from a handful of tech companies toward broader stakeholders including workers, artists, educators, civil society organizations, researchers, and advocates committed to beneficial AI development.

The initiative operates on the core principle that **AI is not destiny, it is design**—emphasizing that technology must be steered by humans, not the other way around. This represents one of philanthropy's largest coordinated responses to AI's rapid advancement and growing influence across all sectors of society.

## Program Format

### Funding Structure

**Total Commitment**: $500 million over 5 years (2025-2030)

**Two Funding Tracks:**

1. **Aligned Grantmaking** (Fall 2025 onwards)
   - Each foundation makes grants from their own portfolios
   - Grants align with one or more of Humanity AI's five priority areas
   - Foundations maintain their individual grantmaking processes
   - Coordinated strategy across all 10 foundations

2. **Pooled Fund** (Beginning 2026)
   - Managed by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors
   - Combined resources from multiple foundations
   - Centralized grant decisions for strategic initiatives
   - Dedicated staff led by Executive Director (hiring in progress)

### Timeline

- **October 2025**: Initiative publicly announced

### Governance

- Co-chaired by Omidyar Network and MacArthur Foundation
- Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors serves as fiscal sponsor

### Diversity & Inclusion
- **National Black Tech Ecosystem Association** - Building diverse leadership pipelines in STEM
- Ensuring AI development reflects diverse perspectives

## Community & Engagement

### Coalition Philosophy

The initiative explicitly positions itself as a counterbalance to "Big AI" - the handful of tech companies currently dominating AI development. Key principles:

1. **People-centered design**: Technology serves humans, not vice versa
2. **Distributed power**: Decision-making beyond Silicon Valley boardrooms
3. **Civil society voice**: Advocacy organizations at the table
4. **Long-term thinking**: Five-year commitment reflects patient capital approach
5. **Coordinated action**: Unified strategy across multiple funders

### Stakeholder Engagement

**Primary audiences**:
- Workers and labor organizations
- Artists, creators, and cultural institutions
- Civil society organizations
- Community-based organizations
- Educators and educational institutions
- Researchers and policy experts
- Technologists committed to beneficial AI

**Geographic scope**: While U.S.-based foundations lead the initiative, the coalition is open to global partnerships and recognizes AI's worldwide impact.

### Coalition Growth

The founding members explicitly welcome additional funders to join the coalition, recognizing that $500M, while substantial, represents only a fraction of the investment needed to ensure AI serves humanity's interests.

## How to Get Involved

## Strategic Context

### Why Now?

The coalition's October 2025 launch comes at a critical juncture:
- Rapid AI deployment across all sectors without adequate safeguards
- Concentrated power among handful of tech companies
- Growing evidence of AI's negative impacts on workers, artists, and communities
- Lack of regulatory frameworks keeping pace with technology
- Widening gap between AI developers and affected communities

### Comparison to Other AI Initiatives

**What makes Humanity AI different**:
- **Philanthropic, not corporate**: No profit motive or shareholder pressure
- **People-centered**: Explicit focus on community benefit, not just technical capabilities
- **Power redistribution**: Seeks to shift influence away from tech giants
- **Coalition approach**: Coordinated strategy across multiple major funders
- **Long-term commitment**: Five years of sustained investment
- **Civil society focus**: Centers advocacy organizations, not just academic research

**Scale in context**:
- $500M over 5 years = $100M/year average
- Compares to billions spent annually by tech companies on AI development
- Represents philanthropy's recognition that civil society needs resources to match corporate power

### Connection to Other Innovation Insights

Similar to the autonomous vehicles and Transformers case studies, Humanity AI reflects understanding that:
1. **Patient capital matters**: Five-year commitment allows long-term thinking
2. **Multiple stakeholders required**: Can't leave innovation solely to corporations
3. **Public interest investment needed**: Market forces alone won't ensure beneficial outcomes
4. **Institutional coordination valuable**: Coalition approach pools resources and expertise

## Leadership & Governance

## Funding Philosophy

The $500 million commitment reflects several strategic choices:

1. **Collective action**: Pooling resources creates greater impact than individual foundation efforts
2. **Urgency and patience**: Large upfront commitment with five-year timeline
3. **Multiple modalities**: Both aligned and pooled funding allows flexibility
4. **Openness to growth**: Coalition designed to expand beyond founding 10 members
5. **Civil society investment**: Recognition that advocacy and community organizations need resources to participate effectively in AI governance

Similar to AI2050 and Project Positive Sum, Humanity AI reflects understanding that breakthrough innovation and beneficial technology development require patient capital, long-term thinking, and investment beyond what market forces naturally support.
