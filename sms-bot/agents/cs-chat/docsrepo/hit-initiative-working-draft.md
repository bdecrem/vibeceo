# Human Interest Technology Initiative: A Blueprint for Global Innovation Infrastructure

An International Collaboration in the Spirit of the Iconic Bell Laboratories

## Executive Summary

The Human Interest Technology (HIT) initiative represents a comprehensive approach to creating global innovation infrastructure that replicates the transformative success of Bell Laboratories. HIT will bridge the critical gap between philanthropic AI research investments and sustainable commercial translation, enabling breakthrough discoveries to become beneficial technologies that serve human welfare.

This Human Interest Technology (HIT) initiative builds upon the visionary insight of **_Sender Cohen_**, who recognized the opportunity to resurrect the transformative power of Bell Laboratories. HIT will extend Cohen's vision by creating a global collaboration spanning innovation hubs across continents, funded via a blended finance model that will include philanthropic, impact first, and market rate capital.

**What HIT Is**: HIT will create a global collaboration spanning three primary research consortiums—a U.S. academic alliance (UCLA, Berkeley, Stanford, Cornell Tech), a Middle East research consortium, and an African research network through the Dunia Institute—connected through two initial commercialization partners: Nevo Labs and Principal Venture Partners. This structure enables coordinated research with systematic commercial translation capabilities.

**Why HIT Adds Value**: Unlike traditional venture capital's short-term growth pressures, HIT will provide patient capital that enables quality development over rapid revenue maximization. The initiative will serve as a commercial translation layer for existing philanthropic AI research, extending research timelines through sustainable business models while accessing exceptional global talent in regions where supply exceeds demand, creating significant economic advantages.

**Why HIT Is Compelling**: HIT will authentically commit to human interest sustainable beneficial technology through broad-based employee and partner ownership, systematic safeguards against mission drift, and economic structures that reward long-term commitment to human welfare rather than short-term extraction.

**Current Phase**: This concept is in its initial brainstorming phase and actively welcomes input from potential collaborators, philanthropic partners, academic institutions, and mission-aligned investors who share the vision of research-first innovation for global benefit.

HIT is not intended to compete with existing philanthropic initiatives in responsible technology and artificial intelligence. HIT is meant to complement and collaborate with existing efforts through a collective action approach focused on human welfare and sustainable commercialization.²

HIT's investment model departs from traditional venture capital approaches. It will nurture founders and start-up companies dedicated to addressing the most pressing human problems. These vehicles employ a blended finance approach that will wed appropriate capital solutions with technologies—this will span the spectrum from non-recourse grants to market-rate capital, ranging from debt tailored for intellectual property licensing to venture capital aligned to early-stage, high-impact innovation.

## Initiative Overview: Research-First Innovation for Human Welfare

HIT will seek to emulate the original Bell Labs culture of success: long-term, curiosity-driven academic research combined with the resources of an industrial laboratory, fostering world-changing innovations. Rather than an exclusive pursuit of "bigger is better" large language models, the initiative will dedicate significant time and resources toward discovering innovative applications to address real-world "right now" challenges through lower cost, lower energy Small Language Models (SLMs) and narrowly focused emerging quantum computing technologies—all with sustainable commercial development as a north star.³

The initiative will serve as an invaluable collaboration partner for existing philanthropic efforts, providing complementary capabilities that enhance the impact and sustainability of each:

**Eric Schmidt's AI2050 ($125 million)**: HIT will extend AI2050's 5-year research timeline through commercialization mechanisms, enabling breakthrough discoveries to continue development beyond initial grant periods while maintaining public benefit focus.⁴

**New York State's Empire AI consortium with Tom Secunda ($400+ million)**: HIT will provide global commercialization infrastructure that translates Empire AI's public-good research into sustainable beneficial technologies, creating market pathways that turn academic discoveries into scalable solutions.⁵

**Reid Hoffman's Ethics and Governance of AI Fund ($27 million)**: HIT will implement systematic bias mitigation through diverse global partnerships and broad-based ownership structures that address the power concentration issues Hoffman's fund identifies.⁶

**Pierre Omidyar's Current AI Foundation ($400 million)**: HIT will operationalize Omidyar's vision through economic structures that prevent individual extraction while creating sustainable beneficial technology development.⁷

**David Siegel's Open Athena initiative**: HIT will collaborate with Open Athena by providing the commercial infrastructure to translate breakthrough academic-frontier discoveries into sustainable beneficial technologies while maintaining public interest focus.⁸

As former MIT President L. Rafael Reif warns, "Federal research budgets face an uncertain future, and many universities are struggling to maintain the basic research that drives innovation."⁹ HIT will address this challenge by providing patient capital infrastructure that enables collective action across these initiatives.

## Learning from OpenAI's Mission Drift

HIT's design will directly address the reported governance failures that enabled OpenAI's drift from its founding mission to "ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity."¹⁰ As Karen Hao reveals in her book, "**Empire of AI**," OpenAI's governance structure concentrated decision-making power among a small group, allowing commercial pressures to override nonprofit commitments.¹¹

HIT will create systematic safeguards through multiple oversight layers, broad-based institutional ownership, accepting capital only from values-aligned investors, and stakeholder alignment that embodies Johnson & Johnson's 1943 credo principles: serving humanity first, stakeholders second, and investors last but not least.¹² This philosophical and structural framework will guard against the influences that cause mission drift when greed and growth pressures overwhelm quality, safety, and ethical considerations.

## The Bell Labs Blueprint: Research-First Innovation

HIT will seek to emulate the original Bell Labs culture of success: long-term, curiosity-driven academic research combined with the resources of an industrial laboratory, fostering world-changing innovations. Bell Telephone Laboratories, established in 1925, exemplified "research-first" innovation where fundamental discoveries enabled the transistor, laser, solar cells, and communications satellites.¹³ These breakthroughs required decades of patient development focused on solving practical problems through rigorous application of existing knowledge—precisely the approach that current market-driven innovation cannot support.

HIT will seek long-term and medium-term objectives that emulate this proven model for breakthrough innovation.
