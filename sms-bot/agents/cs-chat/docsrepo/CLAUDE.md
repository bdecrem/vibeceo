# AI Builders - Context for Claude

## What We're Working On

This repository contains research and preparation work for a new program currently codenamed **AI Builders**. This program is modeled after work we did in 2020-2021 called **Mozilla Builders**.

## Historical Context

### Our Mozilla Builders Programs (2020-2021)

We ran two cohorts during our time at Mozilla:

1. **Spring MVP Lab (March 2020)**
   - Archived at: `mozilla-builders-spring-lab/`
   - Original URL: https://builders.mozilla.community/springlab/
   - 12-week program for early-stage projects
   - $16k grants + mentorship

2. **Fix-the-Internet Incubator (2020)**
   - Archived at: `mozilla-builders-archive/`
   - Original URL: https://builders.mozilla.community/old/
   - Three-tier structure:
     - Startup Studio: $75k equity investments
     - MVP Lab: $16k grants
     - Open Lab: $10k prizes
   - 80+ funded projects, 300+ Open Lab participants
   - Research report: `mozilla-fix-the-internet-incubator.md`

### The "New" Mozilla Builders (Post-2021)

After we left Mozilla, a different team launched what they called "Mozilla Builders" - this is documented in `mozilla-builders-post-2021.md`.

**Important**: This is NOT our program and we don't love that particular approach. It's included here for reference only.

## Repository Structure

- `mozilla-builders-spring-lab/` - Complete offline archive of Spring 2020 MVP Lab site
- `mozilla-builders-archive/` - Complete offline archive of 2020 Incubator site
- `mozilla-fix-the-internet-incubator.md` - Comprehensive research report on our 2020 program
- `mozilla-builders-post-2021.md` - Documentation of the later program (not ours)
- `LOG.md` - Informal research notes and insights
- `CLAUDE.md` - This file

## Working Style

- Keep `LOG.md` casual and minimal - it's for quick, unfinished thoughts
- Research reports should be comprehensive with funding details, timelines, and outcomes
- Archive offline copies of relevant historical sites for reference
