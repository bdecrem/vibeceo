# AI2050 - Schmidt Sciences

**Website**: https://ai2050.schmidtsciences.org

**Mission**: "It's 2050. AI has turned out to be hugely beneficial to society. What happened?"

**Leadership**: Eric Schmidt and James Manyika (Co-Chairs)

**Total Funding**: $125 million over 5 years (funded by Eric and Wendy Schmidt)

## Overview

AI2050 is a forward-looking research initiative launched by Schmidt Sciences to explore how artificial intelligence can be developed and deployed to maximize benefits to society by 2050. Rather than focusing solely on technical breakthroughs, AI2050 takes a multidisciplinary approach, bringing together researchers from computer science, economics, policy, ethics, social sciences, and other fields to address the complex challenges and opportunities that AI presents.

The initiative operates on the premise that ensuring AI's beneficial development requires proactive research across multiple dimensions: technical safety and robustness, economic and labor impacts, governance and policy frameworks, ethical considerations, and real-world applications in areas like healthcare, climate, and education.

## How to Get Involved

**Important**: AI2050 operates through a **closed nomination process** and does not accept public applications.

### For Researchers
- **Build relationships** with existing AI2050 fellows and network members
- **Publish research** that addresses beneficial AI outcomes across technical, social, economic, or policy dimensions
- **Engage in multidisciplinary work** that demonstrates ability to bridge technical and societal considerations
- **Participate in relevant conferences** and workshops where AI2050 fellows are active

### For Institutions
- Host AI2050 convenings and workshops
- Encourage faculty to engage with the AI2050 research community
- Support interdisciplinary collaboration on beneficial AI research

### For the Public
- Follow AI2050 research outputs and policy recommendations
- Engage with published reports and findings
- Support evidence-based policy approaches to AI governance

## Strategic Focus

AI2050 distinguishes itself through several strategic priorities:

1. **Long-term orientation**: Focus on 2050 outcomes, not just near-term challenges
2. **Disciplinary diversity**: Intentional inclusion of non-computer science perspectives
3. **Global scope**: Fellows from multiple countries and attention to global equity
4. **Action-oriented**: Emphasis on practical solutions, policy recommendations, and real-world applications
5. **Proactive approach**: Anticipating challenges before they become crises

## Research Outputs

The initiative produces:
- Academic publications across multiple disciplines
- Policy briefs and recommendations
- Technical reports on AI safety and robustness
- Economic analyses of AI's labor market impacts
- Convening reports synthesizing community discussions

## Funding Philosophy

The $125 million investment over 5 years reflects Schmidt's commitment to patient capital and long-term thinking—similar to the Bell Labs model. This sustained funding allows researchers to:
- Pursue ambitious, high-risk projects
- Take interdisciplinary approaches that don't fit traditional funding silos
- Focus on 25-year outcomes rather than short-term metrics
- Build collaborative networks across institutions and disciplines
