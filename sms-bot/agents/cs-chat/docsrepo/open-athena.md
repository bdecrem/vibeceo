## Overview

Open Athena is a nonprofit organization founded in early 2024 that partners with leading academic laboratories to advance AI model development for scientific research. The organization operates on the hypothesis that **scientific foundation models will be critical infrastructure for a new era of major scientific discoveries**.

Open Athena addresses a fundamental challenge in academic science: while foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing and structural biology, their potential impact across multiple scientific domains is limited by **data and model scale, cost, and quality**. Academic research labs often lack the engineering talent, infrastructure, and resources needed to build and deploy large-scale AI models that could transform their fields.

The organization bridges this gap by embedding elite AI and data engineering talent into university labs, providing infrastructure for model training and deployment, and building open-source software to accelerate scientific discoveries across all domains.

### What Are Scientific Foundation Models?

**Scientific foundation models** are large AI models:
- Trained on broad scientific data using self-supervision at scale
- Can be adapted to a wide range of downstream scientific tasks
- Inspired by foundation models like GPT (language) and AlphaFold (protein structures)
- Domain-specific rather than general-purpose language models
- Trained on physical principles, experimental data, simulations

**Examples across domains** (as of 2024):
- **Materials Science**: MatterGen (suggests new materials), MatterSim (predicts material behavior)
- **Drug Discovery**: TamGen (molecules for tuberculosis, COVID-19 treatments)
- **Climate**: Aurora (weather/pollution forecasting), spherical diffusion models for climate simulation
- **Biology**: Protein conformation models, fine-tunable biological foundation models
- **Physics**: Polymathic AI models spanning climate to astrophysics
- **Chemistry**: Molecular property prediction, chemical synthesis planning

## The Problem Open Athena Solves
