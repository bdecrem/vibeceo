## 1. Fuzzy Matching & Authorship Data Setup

### The Problem We Solved

**Before:**
- Used name-based Author nodes: `MERGE (a:Author {name: $name})`
- "John Doe" at Stanford + "John Doe" at MIT = same Author node ❌
- Impossible to distinguish between multiple people with same name
- 292,523 Author nodes for 845,485 authorships (incorrect merging)
- Author metrics (h-index, paper counts) corrupted by duplicates

**After:**
- Authorship-based model: Each paper appearance = unique Author node with unique KID
- 845,485 Author nodes for 845,485 authorships (1:1 mapping)
- Fuzzy matching assigns `canonical_kid` to link duplicates
- Can accurately query "all papers by THIS John Doe at Stanford"

### Migration Progress

**Completed:**
- ✅ Oct 12 (222 papers, 1,180 authors) - Migrated & fuzzy matched
- ✅ Oct 13-23 (3,685 papers, 20,268 authors) - Migrated & fuzzy matched
- ✅ **21,448 authors (2.5%) now in new system**

**Remaining:**
- ⏳ Full database: 160,766 papers, ~824,000 authors still need migration
- ⏳ Estimated time: 5-6 hours for migration + 40-50 hours for fuzzy matching

### Fuzzy Matching Results (Oct 12 Test)

**From 1,180 authors:**
- **1,018 (86%)**: Unique authors - no duplicates found
- **126 (11%)**: High confidence matches (≥80%) - linked to existing author
- **36 (3%)**: Uncertain matches (60-79%) - flagged for human review

**Examples of successful matches:**
- Mohammad Aflah Khan (100% confidence, 2+ shared co-authors)
- Dawn Song (100% confidence, same affiliation + co-authors)
- "Yizhi Li" vs "Yizhi LI" (75% confidence, needs review)

### How Fuzzy Matching Works

**Three signals (scored 0-100):**
1. **Co-author overlap** (0-50 points)
   - 2+ shared co-authors = 50 pts (strong signal)
   - 1 shared co-author = 25 pts
2. **Name + affiliation match** (0-30 points)
   - Exact name + same institution = 30 pts
3. **Research area overlap** (0-20 points)
   - 2+ shared categories = 20 pts
   - 1 shared category = 10 pts

**Decision thresholds:**
- **≥80%**: Assign canonical_kid to existing author (high confidence)
- **60-79%**: Assign canonical_kid but flag `needs_review=true`
- **<60%**: Mark as own canonical (different person)

### Data Structure

**Author node fields:**
```
{
  kochi_author_id: "KA_abc123",     // Unique ID for this authorship
  canonical_kid: "KA_xyz789",       // Points to canonical author
  canonical_confidence: 95,          // Match confidence score
  is_canonical: true/false,          // Is this THE canonical node?
  needs_review: true/false,          // Human review needed?
  name: "John Doe",
  affiliation: "Stanford University",
  first_seen: date("2024-03-15"),
  last_seen: date("2025-10-12"),
  paper_count: 1
}
```

**Query example - All papers by Dawn Song:**
```cypher
MATCH (a:Author {canonical_kid: 'KA_78caf893-d8e'})-[:AUTHORED]->(p:Paper)
RETURN a.name, p.title, p.published_date
ORDER BY p.published_date DESC
```

## 2. What We Can Already Do

### Data Currently Available

**Internal Database Signals:**
- ✅ **160,766 papers** (AI/ML papers from arXiv)
- ✅ **845,485 authorships**
- ✅ **Academic affiliations**: 31% coverage on new data (from arXiv submissions)
- ✅ **Co-author networks**: Who collaborates with whom
- ✅ **Research categories**: Paper topics (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CV, etc.)
- ✅ **Publication dates**: Track author activity over time
- ✅ **Paper abstracts**: Full text available for analysis

### Queries We Can Run (Post-Migration)

**Author Intelligence:**
- "Show me all researchers at Stanford working on multimodal AI"
- "Who are Dawn Song's most frequent collaborators?"
- "Which authors published 5+ papers in the last 6 months?"
- "Find rising stars: authors with accelerating publication rates"

**Research Landscape:**
- "Who works at the intersection of NLP and computer vision?"
- "Map collaboration networks between universities"
- "Track how an author's research topics evolved over time"
- "Find experts in a specific research area"

**Institutional Analysis:**
- "Which universities produce the most AI research?"
- "Who are the top 10 most prolific authors at MIT?"
- "Find cross-institutional research collaborations"

### Example Metrics We Can Calculate

**Per-author (via canonical_kid):**
- Total paper count
- Publication frequency/velocity
- Collaboration breadth (# of unique co-authors)
- Research area diversity
- Institutional affiliations over time
- First/last publication dates

**Collaboration networks:**
- Who works with whom
- Research team identification
- Cross-institution partnerships
- Advisor-student relationship inference (via co-authorship patterns)

## 3. Next Steps: Data Enrichment Opportunities

### High Priority - Immediately After Full Migration

**1. Complete the Migration & Fuzzy Matching**
- **Action**: Run full migration on remaining 824K authors
- **Time**: 5-6 hours migration + 40-50 hours fuzzy matching
- **Impact**: Enables all subsequent enrichment work
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  python3 migrate_to_authorship_based_authors.py
  python3 kochi_fuzzy_match_v2.py --all
  ```

**2. Human Review of Uncertain Matches**
- **Action**: Build dashboard to review 60-79% confidence matches
- **Current**: ~3% of authors flagged as `needs_review=true`
- **Impact**: Improve canonical_kid accuracy
- **Estimated**: ~25,000 cases to review (3% of 845K)

### Medium Priority - External Enrichment

**3. GitHub Username Extraction**
- **Source**: Parse paper abstracts/bodies for GitHub URLs
- **Method**: Regex patterns + validation
- **Coverage estimate**: 5-10% of papers include GitHub links
- **Value**: High - indicates active code contributions
- **Implementation**:
  - Read paper abstracts (already in database)
  - Extract URLs matching `github.com/[username]`
  - Validate GitHub account exists
  - Link to canonical_kid

**4. ORCID ID Matching**
- **Source**: ORCID public API
- **Method**: Query by name + affiliation
- **Coverage estimate**: 30-40% of authors (many academics have ORCID)
- **Value**: High - unique identifier, links to full publication history
- **Implementation**:
  - Query ORCID API with author name + affiliation
  - Score matches (name similarity + affiliation match)
  - Store ORCID ID on canonical Author node

**5. Semantic Scholar Integration**
- **Source**: Semantic Scholar API
- **Method**: Search by paper title or arXiv ID
- **Coverage estimate**: ~80% (Semantic Scholar indexes most arXiv)
- **Value**: High - citation counts, h-index, influential papers
- **Data available**:
  - Author IDs (for disambiguation)
  - Citation counts per paper
  - h-index calculation
  - "Influential citation" metrics
  - External references

### Lower Priority - Nice to Have

**6. Google Scholar Profiles**
- **Source**: Scraping (risky) or manual curation
- **Method**: Search by name + affiliation, verify match
- **Coverage estimate**: Variable, 20-40%
- **Value**: Medium - h-index, citation counts (but risky to scrape)
- **Challenges**: No official API, anti-scraping measures

**7. Academic Homepage Detection**
- **Source**: Google search or institutional directories
- **Method**: Search "[name] [institution] homepage"
- **Coverage estimate**: 30-50% for faculty
- **Value**: Medium - contact info, research interests, CV
- **Implementation**: Complex, would need web scraping + validation

**8. Email Address Collection**
- **Source**: Institutional directories, paper PDFs
- **Method**: Parse PDFs for contact info, institutional directories
- **Coverage estimate**: Low, 5-15%
- **Value**: Low - privacy concerns, often outdated
- **Challenges**: Privacy, GDPR compliance, accuracy

**9. Twitter/X Academic Profiles**
- **Source**: Twitter API (limited) or manual linking
- **Method**: Search by name + "AI researcher" etc.
- **Coverage estimate**: 10-20%
- **Value**: Low - optional, engagement metrics
- **Challenges**: API restrictions, verification difficulty

### Technical Enrichment - Derived Metrics

**10. Citation Network (via Semantic Scholar)**
- **Action**: Build citation graph between papers
- **Method**: Import citation data from Semantic Scholar
- **Impact**: Calculate PageRank-style influence scores
- **Queries enabled**:
  - "Most cited papers in multimodal AI"
  - "Find seminal papers that influenced current research"
  - "Author influence score based on citation network"

**11. Research Area Clustering**
- **Action**: Use LLM to categorize papers into fine-grained topics
- **Method**: Pass abstract to Claude, get topic labels
- **Impact**: Better "find experts in X" queries
- **Example topics**: "vision transformers", "RLHF", "efficient inference"

**12. Author Trajectory Analysis**
- **Action**: Calculate velocity, acceleration metrics
- **Method**: Time-series analysis on publication rates
- **Impact**: Identify "rising stars" automatically
- **Metrics**:
  - Papers per year (velocity)
  - Change in publication rate (acceleration)
  - Topic shift over time
  - Collaboration pattern evolution
