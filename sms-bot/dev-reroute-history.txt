[2025-07-08T16:52:27.859Z] SENT (SMS): "wtaf make me a fun habit tracker app called “Pizzaface.” I want to reduce 3 things: eating pizza, staying up late, and drinking more than 1 matcha latte per day. Let me set weekly goals for each one. The pizza and late-night goals are weekly maximums (e.g. no more than 2 pizzas or 2 late nights per week). The matcha goal is daily — I should drink no more than 1 per day, and succeed if I follow that 5 out of 7 days. If I hit at least 2 out of 3 goals, reward me with fun emoji badges. If I fail all 3, turn my avatar into a pizza zombie. Make it playful, weird, and use Supabase for storage"
[2025-07-08T17:01:13.553Z] SENT (SMS): "wtaf make me a habit tracker app called "Daily Goals." I want to track 3 habits: limiting screen time to 2 hours, getting 8 hours of sleep, and drinking 8 glasses of water daily. The app should show a 7-day week view where I can check off whether I completed each habit. When I complete all 3 habits in a day, I earn a gold star emoji. If I maintain a 5-day streak for any habit, I unlock achievement badges (like 💧 for hydration master, 😴 for sleep champion, or 📱 for screen time pro). Include a simple progress chart showing my weekly completion rate. Keep the design clean and motivating with a subtle celebration animation when I check off all daily goals. Use Supabase to store my habit logs and achievement history."

When users first open the app, they enter up to 3 daily goals (like "drink water," "exercise," or "read"). Then each day, the app shows today's date and 3 big checkboxes next to their goals. When they check off a goal, it explodes with a random celebration emoji (🎉, ⭐, 🌟, 💪, 🔥, 🌈). At the bottom, show their current week streak. On Sunday, if they hit all their goals every day, trigger an emoji rain animation with 50+ different emojis falling down the screen. If they missed some days, just show a friendly "Nice effort! 🌱" message. Keep the UI super minimal - just the date, 3 checkboxes with goal names, and a weekly progress bar. Use Supabase to save their goals and daily check-ins."
