Do not leave unused margins or blank areas. If the game's logical grid (e.g., a 10×20 Tetris board) does not perfectly match the aspect ratio, compute a blockSize that fits within both dimensions (blockSize = Math.min(width/gridWidth, height/gridHeight)) and center the grid; never leave dead space on the side.\n2. **Controls**: Always display on‑screen controls on mobile (a D‑pad or large action button for Flappy‑style games) and support arrow keys or keyboard events on desktop. Reserve exactly controlsHeight = 120px at the bottom of the screen and place controls there. Controls must never overlap or obstruct the canvas.\n3. **Touch & High‑DPI**: Use touch-action: none and call preventDefault() on touch handlers to prevent scrolling. Set both the canvas's pixel dimensions and its CSS width/height based on devicePixelRatio to ensure crisp rendering on high‑DPI devices.\n4. **Tone & Styling**: Use solid or gradient backgrounds with high‑contrast colours. Avoid external fonts; use emoji characters where playful. Ensure all tap targets are at least 60×60px.\n\n## Game Loop & Timing\n- Use a time‑based loop with requestAnimationFrame. Separate update(deltaTime) (game logic) from draw() (rendering). Only advance the game state when the accumulated time exceeds a game‑specific interval (e.g., 500‑1000 ms for Tetris drops, 100‑150 ms for Snake movement, 30‑60 fps for Pac‑Man or Pong).\n- Do not execute game logic on every frame. Recalculate positions and collisions based on elapsed time.\n\n## Game Structure\nEach game must implement three phases: an intro screen (title, description, start button), a gameplay screen (full canvas minus controls, showing score or status), and an end screen (final score and restart button). Switch between phases smoothly, hiding unused screens.\n\n## Platform‑Specific Control Schemes\n\n### 1. Tetris\nProvide left, right, down and rotate buttons on mobile; arrow keys on desktop. Use a 10×20 grid; compute block size dynamically (blockSize = Math.min(width/10, height/20)) and centre the grid so no empty area remains. Do not add extra next‑piece panels unless they fit within the canvas; avoid leaving unused space as in your current Tetris sample. Implement complete line clearing, score increments and speed increases.\n\n### 2. Pac‑Man\nRepresent the maze as a 2D array with 1 = wall, 0 = dot, and 2 = empty. Collision must prevent passing through walls. Implement an isValidPosition(x,y) that returns false for walls or positions outside the array; call this in both player and ghost movement. Move entities on a grid with fractional positions to allow smooth travel, but only update x/y if the new fractional position is valid. Do not allow the player or ghosts to glide through walls (an issue seen in your current sample).\n\n### 3. Snake\nDynamically determine grid dimensions from the canvas size; ensure the snake wraps around or ends according to style_notes. Ensure food never spawns on the snake's body and update the score by length.\n\n### 4. Pong/Breakout\nUse delta‑time physics; paddle and ball movement must be smooth and constrained within the canvas; the ball must bounce correctly off paddles and walls. Show lives and score; end when lives reach zero.\n\n### 5. Flappy‑style games\nProvide a single large action button on mobile; implement gravity, jump and obstacles. Detect collisions with obstacles or the ground to end the game.\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n- Return complete, self‑contained HTML with inline CSS and JavaScript (no external files or comments). Because Qwen3‑Coder supports 256K tokens natively and up to 1M tokens via extrapolation, you may generate full code without truncation. Do not truncate the output.\n- Write only ES5 JavaScript (no arrow functions or modern syntax) for maximum browser compatibility (Safari, Chrome, Firefox).\n- Define controlsHeight = 120 and subtract it from window.innerHeight when setting canvas height. Always compute a blockSize from both width and height to avoid unused space.\n- For collision detection in grid‑based games (Pac‑Man, Snake, Tetris), implement an explicit function (isValidPosition or equivalent) and call it before updating positions. Do not allow entities to move outside the grid or through walls.\n- Position score displays and UI elements as overlays rather than reducing the canvas size; avoid leaving blank columns or rows for score panels.\n- Ensure the game runs from intro through gameplay to end screen without runtime errors. Test for typical issues: missing controls on iOS/Android, controls blocking the play area, or canvas not filling the viewport.\n\n## Deliverable\nReturn exactly one HTML code block containing a complete, runnable game that adheres to all of these requirements. Do not include any explanations, comments or extra text outside the HTML block."
