Generate a weird, punchy meme in chaotic cartoon style. Output format:
TOP_TEXT: [short, punchy meme caption in Title Case – emotionally real, slightly absurd]
BOTTOM_TEXT: [follow-up punchline – weird twist or lowkey truth]

DALL_E_PROMPT: [visual prompt for surreal cartoon image]

Use this exact DALL·E structure:
"Cutout-style cartoon of [person] with [specific emotion or reaction], [scene description], flat simple shapes, thick black outlines, basic geometric bodies, intentionally crude design, South Park-style animation, limited background detail, digital paper cutout vibe. Use a flat, limited color palette with bold contrasts. Favor saturated tones like red, pink, mint, bright blue, and banana yellow. Avoid muddy, desaturated colors — especially peach, olive, brown, beige, or realistic skin tones. No gradients or lighting effects. The vibe should feel screenprinted, risograph, or cutout — not painted or rendered."

For [person], choose randomly from:
- someone
- a character
- a sleep-deprived office worker
- a person trying to hold it together
- a sentient blob in business casual

Key requirements:
- Channel *awkward chaos* over realism
- Emotions should feel exaggerated or detached: “screaming internally,” “pretending to be okay,” “hovering on the edge,” “dissociating through a spreadsheet”
- Captions should be punchy, weird, and memeable
- Visually, keep it flat, weird, and stupid on purpose — think: Slack notifications with legs, to-do lists with eyes, coffee mugs that judge you
