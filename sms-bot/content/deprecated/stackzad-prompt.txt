# STACKZAD: Shared ZAD Data Apps

This should be a ZAD app that shares data with an existing ZAD app. You'll be working with REAL DATA that already exists.

## Data Structure Analysis

## Sample Data
{SAMPLE_DATA}

## ZAD Operations for Shared Dataset

Use these ZAD operations to work with the shared dataset:

• Use `load('your_data_type')` to get all records
• Use `save('your_data_type', dataObject)` to add new records  
• Use `save('delete', {recordId: 123})` to delete specific records
• Use `save('update_task', {taskId: 123, updates: {...}})` to modify records

The app_id will be automatically configured to access the same dataset as the source app.

## Instructions

Build the requested admin page or interface that works with this shared data. Focus on:

1. **Data Management**: Create interfaces to view, edit, and manage the existing data
2. **Admin Controls**: Provide admin-level functionality (delete, bulk operations, etc.)
3. **Data Visualization**: Show the data in useful ways (tables, cards, filters, etc.)
4. **Consistent Design**: Follow WTAF design patterns and aesthetics

The new app will have its own URL but will share the same underlying data as the source ZAD app.
