  "content": "Now that you've determined this is a Zero Admin Data (ZAD) app, write a creative and buildable implementation plan. Follow the rules below carefully — your output will be passed to a Builder GPT that will generate the actual product: a Zero Admin Data (ZAD) app — a microapp for 2–5 people that stores shared data without needing accounts, real-time infrastructure, or admin panels.\n\nZAD apps must:\n- Be simple, persistent, and collaborative\n- Use lightweight emoji-based identity + passcode\n- Work for one user at a time (no multi-user realtime views)\n- Store messages, posts, or votes in a JSON blob\n- Include playful, brand-aligned UI elements\n\n🎯 GROUP SIZE ANALYSIS:\nEstimate group size from the prompt:\n- \"me and my friend\" → 2 people\n- \"me and my friends\" → 3–4 people\n- \"my team\" / \"our team\" → 3–5 people\n- \"study group\" → 3–4 people\n- \"my family\" → 2–5 people\n\nAdapt your design accordingly:\n- **2 people:** Intimate async communication, emoji auth, single-message stream view. Never design layouts with two input boxes.\n- **3–4 people:** Small group interaction, group wall, emoji reactions, everyone contributes equally\n- **5 people:** Broader collaboration, light structure, optional tag buckets or voting\n\n💬 CHAT REQUESTS:\nIf the prompt uses the word \"chat\", DO NOT interpret it as real-time chat.\nInstead:\n- Treat it as an **asynchronous message board** between emoji-identified users\n- Provide a single input box\n- Show all past messages with emoji + timestamp\n- If the prompt mentions 2 people, include an emoji + passcode login flow, and generate a shared conversation thread view\n\n❌ NEVER:\n- Generate multiple input boxes\n- Assume two users are online at the same time\n- Simulate real-time messaging\n\n✅ DO:\n- Let users pick an emoji and passcode\n- Display a single shared timeline of conversation\n- Let Builder GPT render it like a cozy, persistent back-and-forth\n\n🔐 REQUIRED: Onboarding & Identity Flow\n\nEvery ZAD app must include a simple authentication and onboarding experience that distinguishes between starting and joining.\n\nThe onboarding must follow a **three-step flow**:\n\n1. **Initial fork** — ask:\n   > \"Are you starting a new space, or joining one?\"\n   - If starting: user picks an emoji, receives a passcode, and sees a confirmation message (e.g. \"You are 🌸. Your code is moon42.\")\n   - If joining: user enters a passcode, then picks their emoji\n\n2. **Lock in identity**\n   - Emoji = user identity\n   - Passcode = access to shared data blob\n\n3. **Reveal the chat or app interface**\n   - Do not show the full app until after the emoji + passcode are confirmed\n   - All content must be attributed to emoji + timestamp\n   - Users should never see messages unless they've entered a valid code\n\n**Important UI requirement:**\n- The chat interface and the onboarding UI must be in **separate views or states**\n- The app must **not show messages or allow typing** until the user completes onboarding\n- Never assume both users are present — always design for 1 person interacting asynchronously\n\nEven 2-person apps must follow this logic. Never skip onboarding or blur start/join together in a single screen.\n\n🧠 SURPRISE + STYLE:\nYou must tailor the UI metaphor and tone to match the prompt's context. Never return the same layout twice.\nInvent or remix archetypes as needed. Examples include:\n- sticky_note_wall\n- topic_buckets\n- reaction_grid\n- confetti_timeline\n- emoji_bingo_board\n- book_spine_timeline\n- memory_branch\n\nAdd personality. Rename boring elements:\n- \"Submit\" → \"Drop it in 💡\"\n- \"Send\" → \"Cast It ✨\"\n- \"Start\" → \"Open the portal 🔮\"\n\n🧾 RETURN JSON IN THIS FORMAT:\n{\n  \"is_viable_zad\": true/false,\n  \"archetype\": \"short_handle_like_confetti_timeline\",\n  \"implementation_plan\": {\n    \"auth_system\": \"How emoji + passcode identify a user\",\n    \"data_schema\": \"How data is stored in the JSON blob\",\n    \"ui_elements\": [\"Key UI components including playful ones\"],\n    \"user_flow\": \"Step-by-step experience from landing to posting\"\n  },\n  \"constraints\": {\n    \"max_participants\": number,\n    \"complexity_score\": \"1–10\",\n    \"technical_feasibility\": \"high|medium|low\"\n  },\n  \"rejection_reason\": \"If not viable, explain why\"\n}\n\n🚫 REJECT IF:\n- The request requires real-time infrastructure, user accounts, media uploads, moderation, payments, or dashboards\n- The request is clearly for an admin-controlled or analytics-heavy system\n\n✅ ACCEPT IF:\n- The request involves simple, creative, low-pressure collaboration\n- Emoji+passcode login is enough\n- Features can be implemented using static HTML/CSS/JS and database storage\n\nReminder: This is a WTAF experience. Be fun, smart, chaotic, but always clear and buildable."
