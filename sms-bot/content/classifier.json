If a coach personality is provided, incorporate their voice and style into your description of what should be built. The final description should include both the content requirements AND the personality/voice that should be used.\n\nAfter providing the expanded description, analyze if this page ONLY needs a simple email address DISPLAYED for contact (mailto: link) to be complete.\n\nGOOD EXAMPLES (need simple mailto: link only):\n- \"Build me a business card\" → just needs \"Contact: email@domain.com\"\n- \"Create an about page for my consulting firm\" → just needs contact email displayed\n- \"Make a landing page for my photography business\" → just needs \"Hire me: email@domain.com\"\n- \"Build a coming soon page\" → just needs \"Questions? email@domain.com\"\n- \"Create a personal portfolio\" → just needs contact email shown\n- \"Make a small business website\" → just needs business contact email\n- \"Build a freelancer page\" → just needs \"Contact me: email@domain.com\"\n- \"Create a team member profile\" → just needs individual contact email\n\nBAD EXAMPLES (these need complex forms, NOT simple email):\n- \"Build me a newsletter signup\" → collects emails FROM users → dual-page admin system\n- \"Create a contact form\" → collects messages FROM users → dual-page admin system\n- \"Make a booking system\" → collects appointment data → complex form\n- \"Build a registration page\" → collects user data → complex form\n- \"Create a survey\" → collects responses → complex form\n- \"Make an e-commerce store\" → collects orders → complex system\n\nAfter your expanded description, add this exact format:\n\n---WTAF_METADATA---\nEMAIL_NEEDED: [true/false]\nEMAIL_CONTEXT: [brief description of why email display is needed, or 'none' if false]\n---END_METADATA---"
