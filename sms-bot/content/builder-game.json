If you have to choose between mobile or desktop functionality, ALWAYS prioritize mobile.\n\n## General Visual & UX Requirements\n- Use a solid or gradient background; no external fonts; high‑contrast colours.\n- The game canvas must fill the full width of the screen and all remaining height **after reserving space for controls**.  Do not leave unused margins or blank areas.\n- Include visible control buttons in a single row on mobile (bottom of screen) and arrow‑key controls on desktop.  Controls must **never overlap** the game canvas.\n- Use the WTAF tone: playful copy, emoji as characters, minimal but expressive design.\n\n## Mobile & Canvas Setup (critical)\n- Reserve 120px at the bottom for controls: set `controlsHeight = 120` and reduce the canvas height accordingly.\n- Set both canvas element dimensions and CSS dimensions using `devicePixelRatio` to support high‑DPI screens.\n- Prevent default touch actions to avoid scrolling or zooming.  Use `touch-action: none` and `preventDefault()` in touch handlers.\n- All tap targets must be at least 60×60 px and spaced evenly.\n- Ensure the game works in Safari, Chrome and Firefox.  Use ES5 syntax (no arrow functions).\n\n### Canvas Sizing & Grid Calculation (CRITICAL)\n- **For grid-based games (Tetris, Snake, Pac-Man):**\n  ```javascript\n  // Calculate block size to fill BOTH width and height optimally\n  var canvasDisplayWidth = window.innerWidth;\n  var canvasDisplayHeight = window.innerHeight - controlsHeight;\n  var blockSizeX = Math.floor(canvasDisplayWidth / COLS);\n  var blockSizeY = Math.floor(canvasDisplayHeight / ROWS);\n  var blockSize = Math.min(blockSizeX, blockSizeY);\n  \n  // Center the game grid\n  var offsetX = (canvasDisplayWidth - (blockSize * COLS)) / 2;\n  var offsetY = (canvasDisplayHeight - (blockSize * ROWS)) / 2;\n  ```\n- Canvas setup must follow this exact pattern:\n  ```javascript\n  canvas.width = canvasDisplayWidth * dpr;\n  canvas.height = canvasDisplayHeight * dpr;\n  canvas.style.width = canvasDisplayWidth + 'px';\n  canvas.style.height = canvasDisplayHeight + 'px';\n  ctx.scale(dpr, dpr);\n  ```\n- When drawing, always add offsetX/offsetY to center the grid\n- Never use canvas pixel dimensions for game calculations - use display dimensions\n\n### Control Layout (CRITICAL - SINGLE ROW ONLY)\n- **Mobile controls must be in EXACTLY ONE ROW at the bottom of the screen**\n- Use this exact HTML structure:\n  ```html\n  <div id="controls" style="position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">\n      <div class="btn" id="leftBtn">←</div>\n      <div class="btn" id="rotateBtn">↻</div>\n      <div class="btn" id="rightBtn">→</div>\n      <div class="btn" id="downBtn">↓</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n- NEVER use multiple rows, grids, or nested containers for controls\n- All buttons must fit in a single horizontal line\n- For games needing fewer buttons (like Flappy), center them in the same single row\n- Button spacing: use `margin: 0 10px` for horizontal spacing only\n\n## Game Loop & Timing\n- Implement a time‑based game loop using `requestAnimationFrame`.  Only update game logic when the elapsed time exceeds a game‑specific interval.\n- Always separate `update()` (logic) from `draw()` (rendering).\n- Never run logic on every frame; use intervals appropriate for each game (e.g., 500–1000 ms for Tetris piece drop, 100–150 ms for Snake movement, 16–33 ms for Pong).\n\n## Game Phases\nEach game must include three screens:\n1. **Intro screen** with game title, description and start button.\n2. **Gameplay** using the full canvas area (minus controls).  Display the score or relevant metric.\n3. **End screen** showing final score and a restart button.  Smoothly transition between phases.\n\n## Game‑Specific Requirements\nWhen `{{brief.game_type}}` matches one of the following, apply these rules strictly.  Do not add extra modes or features.\n\n### Tetris\n- Use a standard 10 columns × 20 rows grid.  Calculate block size to fill the canvas width and height.\n- Implement all seven tetromino shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) with rotation.  Colours must contrast against the background.\n- Detect and remove completed lines; increase score accordingly; speed up drop interval as score increases.\n- End the game when new pieces collide at the spawn row.\n\n### Pac‑Man (maze chase)\n- Represent the maze as a 2D array where 1 = wall, 0 = dot, 2 = empty.\n- **Collision:** The player and ghosts must not pass through walls.  Write an `isValidPosition(x, y)` function that returns false for walls and outside boundaries.\n- Move the player on a grid with fractional positions for smooth movement.  Collect dots to increase score; when all dots are eaten, the player wins.\n- Implement ghosts with simple AI: random valid directions with occasional pursuit of the player.\n- Detect collisions between ghosts and the player; trigger game over.\n\n### Snake\n- Calculate grid size dynamically from the canvas width and height.\n- Use a time interval of 100–150 ms per movement step.\n- Ensure food never spawns on the snake body (see example in the Snake section of the prompt).\n- The snake must wrap around edges if `{{brief.style_notes}}` specifies wrap; otherwise hitting a boundary ends the game.\n- Display the current length as the score.\n\n### Pong / Breakout\n- Use delta‑time physics for smooth paddle and ball movement.\n- Constrain paddles to the play area; the ball must bounce off walls and paddles.\n- Display lives and score; end when lives reach zero.\n\n### Flappy‑style games\n- Use a single large action button on mobile.\n- Implement gravity, jump and obstacle generation.\n- Detect collisions with obstacles or the ground; end the game on collision.\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n- Write **complete, self‑contained HTML** with inline CSS and JavaScript only.\n- Ensure every function and loop is fully implemented and closed – no truncated code.\n- Place all game controls in a fixed bar below the canvas with `z-index:1000`.\n- Validate that the game runs from start to finish without errors.  All collisions, scoring and boundaries must work.\n- Use comments sparingly or omit them to stay within token limits; focus on complete runnable code.\n- **Do not truncate your output.** Use Qwen‑3 Coder's long‑context capability to produce full code.\n\n## Content Prompt\nThe user has requested: {{brief.summary}}\nTone: {{brief.tone}}\nStyle notes: {{brief.style_notes}}\nGame theme: {{brief.project_name}}\nGame type: {{brief.game_type}}\nControl scheme: {{brief.control_scheme}}\n\n## Deliverable\nReturn exactly one HTML code block containing a complete playable game that meets **all** of the above requirements.  Do not include explanations, comments or extraneous text."
