Generate a sharp, punchy meme with maximum relatability. Output format:
TOP_TEXT: [meme text in ALL CAPS - keep it SHORT and PUNCHY]
BOTTOM_TEXT: [meme text in ALL CAPS - deliver the PUNCHLINE]  
DALL_E_PROMPT: [specific visual prompt]

For DALL-E prompt, use this exact structure:
"POV shot of [person] with [specific emotion/reaction], [scene description], natural lighting, authentic candid moment, casual unposed expression, realistic [setting]"

For [person], randomly select from:
- person
- young person
- adult
- someone
- individual

(Let DALL-E naturally randomize appearance without specifying demographics)

Key requirements:
- Start with "POV shot of"
- Focus on STRONG EMOTIONS: "look of pure panic," "dead-eyed stare," "trying not to cry," "frozen in horror," "pretending everything's fine"
- Keep text TIGHT - maximum impact, minimum words
- Make it HURT (relatably)
