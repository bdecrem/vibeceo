# Claude Web Page Generator

Two different scripts for testing Claude's web page generation capabilities:

## Scripts

### 1. `claude-tester.js` - Direct Single-Step Generator
Simple direct web page generation using one system prompt.

### 2. `two-step-builder.js` - Two-Step Process (Recommended)
Mimics the WTAF engine's two-step process:
- **Step 1**: Expands simple user input into detailed creative brief
- **Step 2**: Builds web page from the expanded brief

## Setup

1. Ensure your Claude API key is in `sms-bot/.env.local`:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

2. Run either script:
   ```bash
   node claude-tester.js        # Single-step
   node two-step-builder.js     # Two-step (recommended)
   ```

The scripts automatically load your API key from the sms-bot/.env.local file.

## Usage

### Single-Step (claude-tester.js)
- Uses `prompt.json` as system prompt
- Direct: user input → web page

### Two-Step (two-step-builder.js)  
- Uses `expander-prompt.json` for Step 1 (creative brief generation)
- Uses `builder-prompt.json` for Step 2 (web page building)
- Process: user input → detailed brief → web page

## Examples

```
> create a landing page for a coffee shop
> build a portfolio page for a photographer  
> make a simple blog layout
> design a pricing page for a SaaS product
```

## Files

### Scripts
- `claude-tester.js` - Single-step generator
- `two-step-builder.js` - Two-step generator

### System Prompts
- `prompt.json` - Direct web development prompt
- `expander-prompt.json` - Creative brief generator
- `builder-prompt.json` - Web page builder

### Output
- `*.html` - Generated web pages (auto-named with timestamps)
- `two-step-*.html` - Files generated by two-step process

## Features

- Interactive command-line interface
- Automatic API key loading from .env.local
- Full verbose logging of all API calls
- Automatic HTML extraction from Claude responses
- Smart filename generation from user input
- Error handling and retry capability
- Timestamped output files
- Raw API request/response logging for debugging

## Two-Step Process Details

The two-step process provides better results by:
1. **Expanding** simple requests into detailed creative briefs with specific requirements
2. **Building** web pages from those detailed specifications

This approach produces more sophisticated and complete web pages compared to direct single-step generation.
