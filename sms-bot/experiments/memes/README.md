# Memes Generator

A simple Python script that uses OpenAI's DALL-E 3 to generate meme images.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd sms-bot
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   
   The script automatically loads the OpenAI API key from `sms-bot/.env.local`. Make sure this file exists and contains:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

## Usage

1. **Test Setup** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   cd sms-bot/experiments/memes
   python test-memes-setup.py
   ```

2. **Generate Memes**
   ```bash
   cd sms-bot/experiments/memes
   python memes.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**
   - Enter your meme idea (e.g., "debugging all day and fixing it in one line")
   - The script will generate a meme image using DALL-E 3
   - You'll get a URL to view/download the image
   - Optionally save the image locally

## Example Output

```
