# Scheduled Stock Updates - Production Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

### 1. Database Migration Required ‚ö†Ô∏è

**CRITICAL:** The scheduled stock updates feature requires database tables to be created in production.

```bash
# Run this migration in your production Supabase database
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f migrations/scheduled_stock_tasks.sql
```

**What this creates:**

- `scheduled_stock_tasks` table for storing user schedules
- `scheduled_task_executions` table for execution history
- Proper indexes and RLS policies
- Helper functions for timezone calculations

### 2. Environment Variables ‚úÖ

All required environment variables should already be set:

- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### 3. Production Optimizations ‚úÖ

**Scheduler Frequency:**

- **Development:** Checks every 1 minute
- **Production:** Checks every 5 minutes (optimized for performance)

**Error Handling:**

- Graceful fallbacks if database is unavailable
- In-memory storage as backup
- Comprehensive error logging

### 4. Features Ready for Production ‚úÖ

**Scheduled Updates:**

- ‚úÖ "tell me the price of apple at 7am everyday"
- ‚úÖ "send me my portfolio every morning at 8am"
- ‚úÖ "update me on microsoft and google at 9am daily"

**Natural Language Delete:**

- ‚úÖ "stop sending me apple updates"
- ‚úÖ "stop sending me portfolio updates"
- ‚úÖ "stop my microsoft updates"

**User-Friendly Management:**

- ‚úÖ "SCHEDULES" - View all scheduled tasks
- ‚úÖ "DELETE #1" - Delete by task number
- ‚úÖ Clear success messages

### 5. Production Testing

After deployment, test these scenarios:

1. **Create a scheduled task:**

   ```
   "tell me the price of apple at 3pm daily"
   ```

2. **View scheduled tasks:**

   ```
   "SCHEDULES"
   ```

3. **Delete with natural language:**

   ```
   "stop sending me apple updates"
   ```

4. **Delete by number:**
   ```
   "DELETE #1"
   ```

### 6. Monitoring

**Check these logs in production:**

- `üïê Checking scheduled tasks at [timestamp]`
- `‚úÖ Created scheduled task [task_id]`
- `‚úÖ Deleted scheduled task [task_id]`
- `üì≠ No scheduled tasks due for execution`

**Database monitoring:**

- Monitor `scheduled_stock_tasks` table growth
- Check `scheduled_task_executions` for failed tasks
- Verify RLS policies are working

### 7. Performance Considerations

**Database Load:**

- Scheduler runs every 5 minutes in production
- Only processes tasks due for execution
- Efficient queries with proper indexing

**SMS Costs:**

- Each scheduled task sends 1 SMS per execution
- Monitor usage to prevent unexpected costs
- Consider rate limiting for high-volume users

### 8. Troubleshooting

**If scheduled tasks aren't working:**

1. Check database migration was run
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check scheduler logs for errors
4. Test with "SCHEDULES" command

**If delete commands aren't working:**

1. Check natural language parsing
2. Verify task matching logic
3. Test with exact task numbers

## üéØ Production Status: 100% Ready

**All features tested and working:**

- ‚úÖ Natural language scheduling
- ‚úÖ Natural language deletion
- ‚úÖ User-friendly task management
- ‚úÖ Production optimizations
- ‚úÖ Error handling and fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Database schema ready
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete

**Deployment Steps:**

1. Run database migration
2. Deploy code (already production-ready)
3. Test scheduled functionality
4. Monitor logs and performance
