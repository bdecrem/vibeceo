Edit Agent CLI Status Summary

  ✅ What's Built

  - Complete webhook-based edit agent using Claude CLI (not API)
  - Architecture: Webhook Server → Worker → Claude CLI → Deploy
  - Location: /sms-bot/webtoys-os/agents/edit-agent-cli/
  - Scripts: start-all.sh, webhook-server.js, worker.js
  - Running on: Port 3032 with ngrok tunnel

  🔧 What's Fixed

  - ✅ Environment variables loading correctly
  - ✅ Database queries using correct field structure
  (content_data->>status not status)
  - ✅ Issue status updates working properly
  - ✅ ngrok tunnel established: https://03ffa53d166c.ngrok.app

  📍 Current Status

  The agent is RUNNING but NOT CONNECTED to anything automatic

  - Manual trigger works: curl -X POST 
  https://03ffa53d166c.ngrok.app/trigger
  - Can process issues from the database when triggered
  - Uses Claude CLI for powerful editing (same as --revise command)

  ❌ What's Missing

  - No automatic triggering - Issue Tracker doesn't know about this
  agent
  - No cron job - Unlike V2 agent which runs every 2 minutes
  - Not integrated - Issue Tracker still only works with V2 agent

  🎯 To Make It Fully Functional

  Would need ONE of these:
  1. Update Issue Tracker to POST to webhook when issues are
  submitted
  2. Add a cron job that calls the trigger endpoint every X minutes
  3. Keep it manual - Run when you want to process issues

  💡 Key Difference from V2

  | V2 Agent (Current)          | CLI Agent (New)   |
  |-----------------------------|-------------------|
  | Runs automatically via cron | Manual start/stop |
  | Uses Anthropic API          | Uses Claude CLI   |
  | Always processing           | On-demand only    |
  | Can't turn off easily       | Full control      |

  Bottom line: It's a powerful tool that's ready to use, but needs
  to be manually triggered. Works great, just not automated yet!
