# Migration: Early Access → Admin Users

## Overview
Converting the "Early Access" system to "Admin Users" to support expanded admin functionality.

## Database Changes
- **Field**: `receive_early` → `is_admin`
- **Type**: `BOOLEAN` (unchanged)
- **Default**: `FALSE` (unchanged)

## 🚀 Migration Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard:

```bash
# Open the migration file
cat scripts/migrate-to-admin-users.sql
```

Copy and run the SQL in **Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor**

### 2. Update Environment (Already Done ✅)
- [x] Updated TypeScript types (`lib/supabase.ts`)
- [x] Updated scheduler (`lib/sms/scheduler.ts`) 
- [x] Updated handlers (`lib/sms/handlers.ts`)
- [x] Renamed script: `send-early-message.ts` → `send-admin-message.ts`

### 3. Test Admin Features
After migration, test these admin-only features:
- **Early Delivery**: Admins get messages at 7am PT (vs 9am regular)
- **SKIP Command**: Admins can skip/moderate daily messages
- **Admin Broadcasts**: Use `send-admin-message.ts` for targeted messaging

## 🔍 Verification

Check current admin users:
```sql
SELECT phone_number, is_admin, created_at 
FROM subscribers 
WHERE is_admin = TRUE;
```

## 📋 Current Admin Users
Your current admin users (formerly early access):
- +16508989508 (you)
- +19176555288

## 🎯 Future Admin Features
Now that you have `is_admin`, you can easily add:
- Admin-only commands
- Advanced debugging tools
- Content management features
- User administration
- Analytics and reporting
