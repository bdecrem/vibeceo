The request is for a contact form to be created. This form would be a user-facing interface that allows website visitors to input their contact information and messages. The form should typically include fields for the user's name, email address, subject, and message. Once the user submits the form, the data should be collected and stored in a system where an administrator can access and manage these submissions.

For the backend, there should be an admin dashboard where the user can manage and view the responses collected. This dashboard should provide tools for analyzing the data, such as response summaries, filtering options, and export capabilities for further analysis. Additionally, it may include features for creating and modifying survey questions, setting up conditions or logic for question flow, and possibly options for distributing the survey through various channels (email, social media, etc.).

📝 REQUEST: "build a dating app"
============================================================

🔍 PART 1: Current Classifier (YES/NO for ZAD)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
To build a dating app, the app should facilitate connections between users seeking romantic relationships. Key features should include user profiles, which allow individuals to showcase their interests, photos, and personal information. Users can browse through profiles, and there should be functionality for liking or matching with other users. Once a mutual interest is established, the app should enable private messaging between matched users.

The app should also implement a search or discovery feature, allowing users to filter potential matches based on criteria such as age, location, and interests. There might also be an option for users to receive daily matches based on their preferences.

To enhance user experience, consider adding features like a swiping mechanism to quickly browse profiles, an event or group chat feature to encourage socializing, and profile verification to increase trust among users. Privacy and security measures should be in place to protect user data and personal information.

For the personality and voice, if a coach personality is provided, the app's UI and messaging can reflect that style. For instance, if the coach's style is upbeat and encouraging, the app's onboarding process and notifications can have a friendly, motivational tone, encouraging users to explore and engage with matches.

This app will require the collection and storage of user data, including personal details and interactions. An admin interface will be necessary for managing user accounts, moderating content, and analyzing user interactions to improve the service.
