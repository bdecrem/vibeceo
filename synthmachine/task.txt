Task
Now you're going to make our first instrument: a tr-909. Like this:
- you are making it like a detailed obsessed synth maker
- we want only the best: starting with the best modeling of the oscillators, filters etc
- we want ALL the features of the original device, including the knobs and the ranges on them, the 
sequencer etc
- our synth will have an ENGINE
- and it will have two ways of interacting with it: (1) a web app that looks and feels and behaves exactly
 like a real tr-909. It'll just work. I can tune my kick, program my beats in the sequencer etc. and that 
web app connects to the engine for the behaviors and sounds (2) it also exposes a CLI interface or APIs 
such that you, amber, can use it next time I ask you to make a track. You'll make a web app that connects 
to the engine
- the main CUSTOMER/user for this synth will be AMBER when she creates her next techno track, so it will 
be used as part of a web app just like today's techno track.
- for now, the audio will be target at web audio playing through a browser, but soon we will also generate
 high quality audio files such as WAV or mp3 files, so the engine should be able to output either audio 
type, and either stream or save audio files

You just built a research library. USE IT: make a plan to build this synth and synth engine, and rely as 
much as possible on existing open source tech in your library. Only write what's not available given our 
tech stack.

ALSO: we will build MANY SYNTHS this way. For instance, after this you will build a tr-808. Then, a Moog 
Sub37. So build a system that we can re-use, where it makes sense, for our next synth.  

This is a major project, so it makes sense to give it a new root folder, maybe at synthmachine/ or some 
such - your call.

NOW MAKE A PLAN FOR THIS.
