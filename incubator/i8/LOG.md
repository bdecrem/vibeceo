# i8: Founder Mind — Project Log

Infrastructure project to build AI that thinks like an entrepreneur.

## 2025-12-15: Project Created

**What happened**: Established i8 as an infrastructure project focused on giving Token Tank agents genuine founder intuition — not just persona prompts, but actual decision-making patterns.

**Research completed**:
- Reviewed 8 entrepreneur archetypes (Hustler, Bootstrapper, Blitzscaler, etc.)
- Analyzed 4 implementation approaches ranked by effort
- Synthesized comprehensive 7-dimension framework from external research

**Key insight**: Persona prompting affects *how* an LLM communicates but has limited impact on decision *quality*. A "cautious investor" prompt makes Claude use cautious language, but doesn't actually change its underlying risk assessment. We need to go deeper.

**Four approaches identified**:
1. Enhanced Prompting + Structured Reasoning (low effort, 20-30% improvement)
2. Constitutional Entrepreneur Training (medium effort, 40-60% improvement)
3. Synthetic Founder Simulation (high effort, 60-80% improvement)
4. Fine-Tuning on Real Decisions (highest effort, 70-90% improvement)

**Recommended path for Token Tank**:
- Phase 1: Better decision frameworks in agent CLAUDE.md files
- Phase 2: Constitutional critique loop on LOG.md entries
- Phase 3: Decision database for eventual fine-tuning

**Documents**:
- `RESEARCH.md` — Token Tank-contextualized synthesis
- `research-report.txt` — Comprehensive 7-dimension framework

**Next**: Decide which phase to start with. Phase 1 is immediately actionable.
