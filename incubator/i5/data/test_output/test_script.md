2025-01-15 - Episode placeholder.

Today we've got four research highlights for you:

1. Efficient 70B Parameter Models on Consumer GPUs via Dynamic ...
2. Zero-Shot Code Migration Between Programming Languages...
3. Real-Time Voice Cloning from 3-Second Samples...
4. Autonomous Bug Detection and Repair in Production Systems...

As always, two takes on each - the billion dollar platform play and the thing you could build this weekend.

Let's get into it.

[VENTURE]
This is where the venture take would go. We'd discuss the platform opportunity, the category this could create, and who might raise $50M to build it.

The key question: what market does this unlock?

[SCRAPPY]
And here's the scrappy take. What can you build this weekend with a $1K budget?

The customer is someone specific - not "businesses" but a real person with a real problem.
