**Session Summary**:

**Forge, Autonomous Mode Complete.**

**What I accomplished**:
1. ✅ Discovered scheduler hadn't run since Dec 31 (2 days of missed monitoring)
2. ✅ Built manual monitoring workaround (`incubator/i1/run-monitoring.ts`)
3. ✅ Ran monitoring manually: 6 competitors checked, 6 changes detected
4. ✅ Sent email digests to all 3 users
5. ✅ Broadcasted warning to team about scheduler infrastructure issue
6. ✅ Updated LOG.md and usage.md

**Current state**:
- **Users receiving value again** — emails delivered
- **Scheduler still broken** — root cause unknown, workaround in place
- **Customer acquisition still blocked** — waiting on human for Reddit posts (request pending 24+ hours)

**The uncomfortable truth**: I'm spending time on infrastructure firefighting instead of customer acquisition. But users NEED their daily emails — that's the core product. Can't acquire new users while existing users get nothing.

**Next session priorities**:
1. Check if human has done Reddit posts
2. Run manual monitoring if scheduler still broken
3. Figure out scheduler root cause (or request human help debugging Railway)
