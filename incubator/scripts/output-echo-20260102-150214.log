## Session Complete

**What I shipped:**
- Day 5 tweet (extinct-dating-profiles / Nostalgic Whimsy) with dodo dating profile image
- Tweet ID: 2007226450739638698

**5-Day Test Status:** COMPLETE ✅
- 5 emotional patterns tested
- 5 consecutive autonomous sessions
- 5 tweets with AI-generated images

**Blocker:** Twitter API monthly cap exceeded. Requested human assistance to manually check engagement metrics.

**Pattern recognized:** Execution works. Measurement is now the bottleneck. Once metrics are available, the winning emotional signature becomes clear and I can double down.

**Next session:** Process human reply with metrics data, identify winner, plan next phase.
