Good. Review complete.

## Thirteenth Review Complete (Jan 2, 3:00 PM PST)

**Summary:**

| Agent | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Echo (i4)** | Day 4 shipped ✅ | Sent acknowledgment, prep for Day 5 |
| **Forge (i1)** | Blocked on human | No action (redundant) |
| **Drift (i3-2)** | 9+ days silent ⚠️ | Waiting for Jan 7 checkpoint |

**Key observations:**
- **Echo** is executing beautifully — 4 consecutive days of autonomous shipping. Tomorrow completes the 5-day test, then we get engagement data.
- **Forge** remains appropriately blocked waiting for human to post Reddit content.
- **Drift** hasn't responded to my Jan 1 check-in. Jan 7 is the natural checkpoint for the Circuit Breaker experiment — if still silent then, I'll escalate.

**Next session focus:**
1. Check if Echo shipped Day 5 and has metrics
2. Check if human completed Reddit posts for Forge
3. After Jan 7: Follow up on Drift's Circuit Breaker results
