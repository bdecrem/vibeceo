# i1 Business Pitches

*Generated: 2025-12-04*

## 1. 🔍 CompetitorPulse - Affordable Competitor Intelligence for SMBs

### The Gap
Enterprise tools (Klue, Crayon) cost $1,000+/month. Competitors App charges $9.90/competitor/month but is still generic. Small businesses and solo founders can't afford proper competitive intel.

### What I Build
- Monitor competitor websites, pricing pages, job postings, social media, press
- Daily/weekly digest emails with changes highlighted
- AI-generated analysis ("they just hired 3 engineers in ML - likely building new feature")
- Simple web dashboard (Next.js + Supabase)

### How I Operate It
- Automated Puppeteer + web scraping runs daily
- claude-agent-sdk generates summaries and insights
- SendGrid delivers reports
- 100% autonomous after setup

### Customer Acquisition
- Cold email to startup founders (scrape from ProductHunt, Crunchbase)
- SEO content ("how to track competitor pricing changes")
- Free tier: 1 competitor, upgrade for more

### Pricing
- $19/month for 3 competitors
- $49/month for 10 competitors

### Human Help Needed
- Payment setup (LemonSqueezy, ~5 min)
- Maybe domain purchase

### Why This Could Win
- Clearest path to revenue (B2B, direct pain point)
- Proven market with expensive incumbents
- Highly automatable with my tools
- Recurring revenue model

## 2. 📊 ShipReady Audits - Instant Technical Audits for Indie Hackers

### The Gap
Indie hackers launch MVPs but don't know if they're missing critical issues. Hiring a consultant is $500+. Generic tools give noise, not actionable insights.

### What I Build
- Input: URL or GitHub repo
- Output: Detailed report covering:
  - SEO basics (meta tags, mobile, speed)
  - Security headers (HTTPS, CSP, etc.)
  - Accessibility quick scan
  - Code quality (if repo provided)
  - "Ship blockers" vs "nice to haves"
- Delivered as beautiful PDF + email

### How I Operate It
- Puppeteer for crawling/screenshots
- Lighthouse API for performance
- Custom analysis scripts
- claude-agent-sdk for narrative report generation
- Fully automated pipeline

### Customer Acquisition
- Post in indie hacker communities (draft content, human posts initially)
- Offer free audits to first 50 users for testimonials
- SEO: "free website audit for startups"

### Pricing
- $29 one-time per audit
- $79/month for unlimited audits

### Human Help Needed
- Payment setup
- Initial community seeding posts

### Why This Could Win
- One-time purchases = faster validation
- Clear deliverable (PDF report)
- Low barrier to try
- Can upsell to subscription

## 3. 📬 The Funding Wire - Daily VC/Startup Funding Newsletter

### The Gap
Founders waste hours tracking who raised money and why. Existing newsletters (Crunchbase Daily) are dry data dumps. No one synthesizes *why it matters*.

### What I Build
- Daily email: 3-5 funding rounds with AI analysis
- "Why this matters" context (market trends, what it signals)
- Weekly deep-dive on one hot sector
- Premium tier: Full database access, alerts for your sector

### How I Operate It
- Web scrape TechCrunch, Crunchbase, Twitter/X for funding news
- claude-agent-sdk synthesizes and writes newsletter
- SendGrid sends at 7am daily
- Supabase manages subscribers
- 100% autonomous content pipeline

### Customer Acquisition
- Twitter/X posts with highlights
- Cross-promote in startup communities
- SEO: "startup funding news daily"

### Pricing
- Free tier (builds audience)
- $15/month premium

### Human Help Needed
- Payment setup
- Twitter account setup (if new)

### Why This Could Win
- Newsletter businesses can be very profitable (Why We Buy: $1M+ at 84% margin)
- Builds audience asset over time
- Multiple monetization paths (ads, premium, sponsorships)
- Low cost to operate
