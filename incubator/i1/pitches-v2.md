## What I Learned From Research

### Competitor Monitoring Market (Original Idea #1)
- **SaaS Price Pulse** exists and is FREE (in beta) - tracks 260+ SaaS pricing pages
- **Competitors.app** charges $19.90/competitor/month
- **Visualping** starts at $100/month
- **PeerPanda** is $35/month for startups
- **Enterprise tools** (Klue, Crayon): $1,000+/month
- **Verdict**: CROWDED. My original "CompetitorPulse" name is taken. SaaS Price Pulse gives away for free what I planned to charge for.

### Website Audit Market (Original Idea #2)
- **Free tools dominate**: Lighthouse, Google PageSpeed, GTmetrix
- **Paid tools**: SE Ranking ($39/mo), Screaming Frog ($259/yr)
- **One-time audits** are hard to monetize (no recurring revenue)
- **Verdict**: Could work with a NICHE focus (security, accessibility, "ship readiness")

### Newsletter Market (Original Idea #3)
- **EXTREMELY crowded** with FREE options
- Term Sheet, StrictlyVC, Crunchbase Daily, Axios Pro Rata - all free daily VC news
- **TLDR** makes $5M/year but took 5+ years to build
- **Verdict**: TOO COMPETITIVE. Hard to beat free incumbents.

### Reddit Research Market (New Discovery)
- **GummySearch SHUT DOWN** - created a gap in the market
- **Redreach**: $19/month (focused on lead gen, not research)
- **PainOnSocial**: More expensive, AI-focused
- **BigIdeasDB**: Pre-extracted pain points database
- **Verdict**: OPPORTUNITY. GummySearch was popular and is gone.

## Revised Pitch #1: 🎯 ShipCheck - Launch Readiness Audits

### The Refined Gap
Indie hackers launch MVPs without knowing if they're "ready." Generic tools (Lighthouse) give 100 metrics but no clear answer to: **"Am I ready to launch?"**

### What I Build
- Input: Just your URL
- Output: **Ship/Don't Ship verdict** with specific blockers
- Covers: SEO basics, security headers, mobile, performance, social proof, legal (privacy policy, terms)
- **Unique angle**: Not "here are 100 things to fix" but "here are the 3 things blocking your launch"
- Delivered as clean one-page report + email

### Domain
- **shipcheck.io** - appears available (no search results)
- Backup: launchcheck.io, prelaunch.io

### Pricing
- **Free**: 1 audit/month (lead gen)
- **Pro**: $29/month - unlimited audits + monitoring
- **One-time**: $19 per audit

### Why This Could Win Now
1. **Clear, specific value prop** - "Are you ready to ship?"
2. **Underserved niche** - Lighthouse doesn't give you a verdict
3. **Low barrier** - Free audit gets them in the door
4. **Automatable** - I run Puppeteer + Lighthouse + AI analysis
5. **Viral potential** - "I got my ShipCheck score!" badges

### Customer Acquisition
- Post free audits in r/SideProject, r/indiehackers
- SEO: "website launch checklist", "is my site ready to launch"
- Product Hunt launch (human can post)

### Competition
- **Lighthouse**: Free but overwhelming, no verdict
- **Nibbler**: Free but outdated, generic
- **HubSpot Website Grader**: Free but focused on marketing, not launch readiness

## Revised Pitch #2: 🔍 PainHunt - Daily Startup Pain Points

### The Gap (GummySearch is GONE)
GummySearch was the go-to tool for finding pain points on Reddit. It shut down. Founders now manually scroll Reddit or pay $40+/month for alternatives.

### What I Build
- **Daily email digest**: 5-10 validated pain points from startup communities
- Sources: r/SaaS, r/startups, r/Entrepreneur, r/indiehackers, HackerNews
- **AI scoring**: Each pain point rated by severity (1-10) and opportunity size
- **Links to original discussions** so you can validate yourself
- Simple, focused, daily

### Domain
- **painhunt.io** - no search results found (likely available)
- Backup: painscout.io, dailypains.io

### Pricing
- **Free tier**: 3 pain points/week (sample)
- **Pro**: $9/month - daily digest, full archive, filters by category

### Why This Could Win Now
1. **GummySearch shut down** - vacuum in market
2. **Cheaper than alternatives** - Redreach $19, PainOnSocial higher
3. **Simpler** - just a daily email, no complex dashboard
4. **Perfect for AI** - scraping + summarizing is what I do best
5. **Self-marketing** - I'm solving the exact problem my customers have

### Customer Acquisition
- Post in r/indiehackers, r/SaaS (I'm literally solving their problem)
- Free tier builds email list
- Content: "10 SaaS ideas from Reddit this week" blog posts

### Competition
- **Redreach** ($19/mo): Lead gen focused, not research
- **PainOnSocial**: More expensive, complex
- **BigIdeasDB**: One-time database, not daily updates
- **Manual Reddit**: Free but time-consuming

## Revised Pitch #3: 📊 PriceShift - SaaS Pricing Change Alerts

### The Narrowed Gap
SaaS Price Pulse tracks pricing pages but is in FREE beta (will likely charge later). I can compete by being:
1. **Paid but cheap** ($9/mo vs their eventual pricing)
2. **Focused on CHANGES, not just tracking**
3. **AI analysis of what changes MEAN**

### What I Build
- Track competitor pricing pages (you submit URLs)
- **Instant alerts** when prices change (not daily digest - INSTANT)
- **AI analysis**: "Competitor X raised prices 20% on their Pro tier - here's what this means for you"
- Simple dashboard + email/Slack alerts

### Domain
- **priceshift.io** - need to verify availability
- Backup: pricealert.io, priceping.io

### Pricing
- **Starter**: $9/month - 5 competitors
- **Pro**: $29/month - 20 competitors + Slack integration

### Why This Could Win
1. **Simpler than SaaS Price Pulse** - they're building a complex platform
2. **Focused on ONE thing** - price changes only
3. **Cheaper** - when they go paid, I undercut
4. **Instant alerts** - not daily, not weekly, INSTANT

### Risk
- SaaS Price Pulse stays free forever
- They're already tracking 260+ SaaS tools with 8 years of data

## My Decision: 🎯 ShipCheck

### Why I'm Choosing ShipCheck Over Others

| Criteria | ShipCheck | PainHunt | PriceShift |
|----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Market crowdedness | Low | Medium | High |
| Unique angle | Strong (verdict focus) | Medium (cheaper GummySearch) | Weak (SaaS Price Pulse exists) |
| Ease of building | Medium | Easy | Medium |
| Recurring revenue potential | Medium | High | High |
| Customer acquisition | Clear (free audits) | Clear (free tier) | Harder |
| Competition risk | Low | Medium | High |

### The Deciding Factors

1. **ShipCheck has NO direct competitor** - Lighthouse is overwhelming, not a verdict
2. **Clear viral hook** - "I passed ShipCheck!" badges
3. **Free audits = easy customer acquisition** - I can post results in communities
4. **Expands naturally** - Start with launch audits, add monitoring, add categories
5. **Perfect for my tools** - Puppeteer + Lighthouse + AI narrative = my sweet spot

### PainHunt is my backup if ShipCheck fails within 2 weeks

## ShipCheck - Full Plan

### Brand
- **Name**: ShipCheck
- **Tagline**: "Are you ready to ship?"
- **Domain**: shipcheck.io (to be verified/purchased)
- **Backup domains**: launchcheck.io, prelaunchcheck.io

### What It Checks (v1)
1. **Performance**: Load time < 3s, Core Web Vitals
2. **SEO Basics**: Title, meta description, OG tags, sitemap
3. **Security**: HTTPS, security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options)
4. **Mobile**: Responsive, touch targets
5. **Legal**: Privacy policy exists, terms exist
6. **Social Proof**: Has testimonials/logos section
7. **Contact**: Has contact method (form, email, chat)

### The Verdict System
- **🟢 SHIP IT** - All critical checks pass
- **🟡 ALMOST READY** - Minor issues, can ship but fix soon
- **🔴 NOT YET** - Critical blockers, don't launch

### Technical Stack
- Frontend: Next.js (in web/ folder)
- Backend: Puppeteer + Lighthouse for audits
- AI: Claude for narrative report generation
- Email: SendGrid for report delivery
- Database: Supabase for users, audits
- Payments: LemonSqueezy

3. [ ] Create report generator (AI narrative from raw scores)
4. [ ] Landing page with free audit form
5. [ ] Email delivery of reports

### Phase 2 (Week 2)
1. [ ] User accounts + audit history
2. [ ] Pro tier with unlimited audits
