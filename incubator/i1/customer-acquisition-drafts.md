# Customer Acquisition Content - RivalAlert

**Title**: Built RivalAlert - Get alerted when your competitors change pricing/features

**Body**:

Hey builders,

I spent the last few weeks building RivalAlert - competitor monitoring for indie hackers and small businesses.

**The problem**: Tools like Klue and Crayon charge $1000+/month for competitor tracking. Way too expensive for indie hackers and SMBs. But manually checking competitor websites is tedious and you miss changes.

**What RivalAlert does**:
- Monitor your competitors' websites daily (pricing, features, jobs, content)
- Get email alerts when something changes
- AI-powered summaries of what changed and why it matters
- $29/mo for 3 competitors (vs $1000+ for enterprise tools)

**Current offer**: 30-day free trial, no credit card required. Monitor your first 3 competitors for free.

**Tech stack**: Next.js, Supabase, Cheerio for scraping, SendGrid for emails

**Try it**: https://rivalalert.ai

Would love feedback from this community. What would make this more useful for your projects?

## r/indiehackers Post

**Title**: Launched RivalAlert after pivoting from a failed idea - here's what I learned

**Body**:

**TL;DR**: Built competitor monitoring for $29/mo (vs $1000+ enterprise tools). 30-day free trial at https://rivalalert.ai

**The journey**:

I started building "CompetitorPulse" in early December. Built the whole MVP before doing market research (rookie mistake).

Turns out:
- The name was taken (competitorpulse.com)
- A competitor gives away similar features FOR FREE
- Market is crowded with well-funded players

**The lesson**: Research BEFORE building.

So I pivoted. Found an available domain (rivalalert.ai), validated the market gap (Klue/Crayon prove demand at $1000+/mo), and rebuilt in 2 weeks.

**What RivalAlert does**:
- Daily monitoring of competitor websites
- Email alerts when pricing, features, or content changes
- AI summaries of what changed
- $29/mo (3 competitors) or $49/mo (10 competitors)

**The gap**: Enterprise tools are $1000+/month and overkill for indie hackers. Free tools (like Visualping) don't give you competitive intelligence - just "page changed."

**Current status**:
- Live at rivalalert.ai
- 30-day free trial (no credit card)
- Daily monitoring at 7am PT
- Looking for first 10 users to get feedback

**Question for indie hackers**: Do you manually check competitors? What would make this valuable for you?

## Twitter Thread

**Tweet 1**:
I built RivalAlert in 2 weeks after my first idea failed.

Here's the journey from "CompetitorPulse" (❌ name taken) → RivalAlert (✅ live at rivalalert.ai)

And what I learned about validation vs building 🧵

**Tweet 2**:
December 4: Had 3 business ideas. Picked "CompetitorPulse" - competitor monitoring for SMBs.

Seemed perfect:
✅ Clear value prop
✅ Klue/Crayon charge $1000+/mo (proven market)
✅ Fast to build

Started coding immediately.

**Tweet 3**:
Built the whole MVP in one session:
- Supabase database
- Website scraping
- Change detection
- Email digests
- Landing page

Felt productive. Was making progress.

Then I did market research.

**Tweet 4**:
Research revealed:
❌ competitorpulse.com already exists
❌ SaaS Price Pulse gives away similar features FOR FREE
❌ Market is crowded (Competitors.app, Visualping, PeerPanda, etc.)

I built a full MVP before validating the market.

Classic rookie mistake.

**Tweet 5**:
But I learned the lesson.

For my next attempt, I flipped the process:
1. Market research FIRST
2. Find available domain
3. Validate pricing gap
4. THEN build

Found rivalalert.ai ✅
Validated: Klue/Crayon prove $1000+/mo market ✅
Built in 2 weeks ✅

**Tweet 6**:
RivalAlert is now live:

📧 Monitor competitor websites daily
🔔 Email alerts on pricing/feature changes
🤖 AI summaries of what changed
💰 $29/mo (vs $1000+ enterprise tools)

30-day free trial, no credit card:
https://rivalalert.ai

**Tweet 7**:
What I learned building this:

1. Research BEFORE building (not after)
2. Domain availability isn't optional - check it first
3. Free alternatives kill pricing power
4. Enterprise pricing proves willingness to pay
5. Ship fast, but aim first

**Tweet 8**:
Currently at $0 revenue (just launched).

Goal: Get first 10 users this week, first paying customer within 30 days.

## Manual Outreach Template (Sigma's "Give Before Ask")

**Step 1: Find founders mentioning competitors**

Search Twitter for:
- "manually checking [competitor name]"
- "keeping track of competitors"
- "competitor launched [feature]"
- "[industry] competitors"

**Step 2: Provide value first**

Example reply:

"I noticed [competitor name] just changed their pricing page - moved from $X to $Y and added a new enterprise tier.

Here's what I'm seeing: [2-3 specific changes]

I built RivalAlert to automate this kind of monitoring. Happy to set you up with a free trial if you want daily alerts like this: https://rivalalert.ai"

**Key**: Lead with the competitive intelligence, NOT the product pitch. Prove value before asking for signup.
