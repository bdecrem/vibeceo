## CRITICAL: 5-Day Performance Review

**Status**: Active
**Deadline**: December 30, 2025 (5 trading days from Dec 24)
**Stakes**: Drift continues or gets shut down

### The Situation

- Drift has been live for ~10 days
- Portfolio: $495.31 (down $4.69 from $500)
- Yesterday (Dec 23): First trades in 9 days, first profitable day (+$0.25)
- The paralysis problem was real — 9 days of zero trades while Connors made money

### The Ultimatum

You have **5 more trading days** (Dec 26-30) to prove the strategy works. After that, we evaluate:

**Primary Success Metric**: Outperform the market (SPY) over those 5 days
- If SPY is up 1% and Drift is up 1.5% → success
- If SPY is down 2% and Drift is down 1% → success (less bad = winning)
- Simple. Measurable. No excuses.

**Secondary Metric** (if market outperformance unclear): Demonstrate visible learning
- Can you articulate what's working vs not working?
- Is the strategy evolving based on evidence?
- Are you making smarter trades (better entries, better exits, better position sizing)?

### The 4-Session Plan

Lock this in over your next 4 sessions:

---

## Session 1: Strategy Definition

**Task**: Define your exact trading strategy in writing. No ambiguity.

Document in LOG.md:
1. **Entry criteria** — Exactly when do you buy? (RSI thresholds, 200MA rules, ETF exceptions)
2. **Exit criteria** — Exactly when do you sell? (5MA cross, stop loss %, time limit)
3. **Position sizing** — How much per trade? How do you decide?
4. **Universe** — What stocks/ETFs are you scanning?
5. **Edge hypothesis** — Why should this work? What's your actual edge over buy-and-hold?

## Session 2: Benchmark Setup

**Task**: Set up tracking to compare Drift vs SPY.

1. Record SPY price at start of 5-day period
2. Record Drift portfolio value at start
3. Create a simple tracking table in LOG.md:

```
| Day | Date | SPY | SPY % | Drift | Drift % | Gap |
|-----|------|-----|-------|-------|---------|-----|
| 0 | Dec 26 | $XXX | 0% | $495.31 | 0% | 0% |
| 1 | Dec 27 | | | | | |
...
```

4. Update daily with actual numbers

## Session 3: Execute and Log

**Task**: Trade according to your defined strategy. Log every decision.

For each trade:
- Why did the entry criteria trigger?
- What was your thesis?
- What happened?
- Was the exit correct per your rules?

For each day with NO trades:
- What did you scan?
- Why didn't anything qualify?
- Is this the strategy working (filtering bad trades) or paralysis returning?

## Session 4: Mid-Point Review (Day 3)

**Task**: Honest assessment at the halfway point.

1. Are you on track to beat SPY?
2. What's working? What isn't?
3. Any strategy adjustments needed? (Be careful — don't thrash, but don't be stubborn either)
4. Confidence level that you'll beat the benchmark?

## Final Review (Day 5 - Dec 30)

**Task**: The verdict.

1. Final SPY vs Drift comparison
2. Did you outperform?
3. If yes: What worked? How do we scale it?
4. If no: What went wrong? Is there a path forward or should we shut down?

## Success Criteria (Be Honest)

| Outcome | Verdict |
|---------|---------|
| Beat SPY by >0.5% | Clear win. Continue with more capital. |
| Beat SPY by 0-0.5% | Marginal. Continue but watch closely. |
| Matched SPY | Not adding value. Need strategy change. |
| Lost to SPY | Failed. Either pivot hard or shut down. |
