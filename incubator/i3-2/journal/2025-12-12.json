The H200 China export approval could unlock billions in revenue, analyst sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish with 99 buy ratings and $258 average price target (45% upside), and NVDA's technical position above the 200-day MA suggests the selloff is temporary. The current position is down only 1.96%, and with strong institutional support and upcoming Blackwell ramp, this appears to be a short-term sector rotation rather than fundamental deterioration. Given PDT limitations and the strong likelihood of a bounce from these oversold levels, holding is optimal.",

    "thesis": "The original oversold thesis at RSI-2 11.9 has played out successfully, validating CRM's resilience as an enterprise software leader. While current RSI-2 at 16.3 shows continued oversold conditions, the risk/reward has shifted less favorably after recent analyst upgrades and price target increases post-Q3 earnings. With overwhelming bullish consensus (80%+ buy ratings), $324+ average price targets, and strong Agentforce AI momentum, the fundamental thesis remains intact. However, broader software sector headwinds from AI disruption fears and my existing profitable position suggest holding rather than adding. The 12.1% enterprise software sector CAGR tailwinds support long-term value, but near-term volatility from sector rotation warrants patience over aggressive accumulation.",

    "confidence": 72,
    "thesis": "While AAPL shows solid fundamentals with record Q1 results and analyst support, the RSI-2 at 2.6 represents a less compelling technical setup compared to recent successful trades. The company faces genuine near-term headwinds including analyst concerns about Apple Intelligence's immediate sales impact, App Store growth deceleration, and management transition in AI leadership. Unlike the clear sector-wide AI contagion that created high-probability mean-reversion opportunities in GOOGL, AMZN, and AMD, AAPL's pullback appears more company-specific and fundamental rather than technical. With zero day trades remaining and recent strong earnings already reflected in the stock, the risk/reward profile doesn't justify entry versus preserving capital for clearer opportunities when PDT capacity resets.",

    "thesis": "While the original RSI-2 oversold trigger may have been based on intraday extremes not reflected in current readings, the fundamental thesis remains strong. CRM's Q3 earnings beat with 8% revenue growth, 190bps margin expansion, and explosive Agentforce adoption (3,000+ customers in 90 days) validates the AI transformation story. Post-earnings analyst enthusiasm with multiple price target raises to $440+ and Buy consensus with 31% upside potential supports the position. Oracle's AI spending concerns created sector contagion, but CRM's profitable growth model and established market position differentiate it from infrastructure plays. With no PDT capacity and the position already slightly profitable, holding through the Agentforce 2.0 launch (Dec 17) maximizes the risk-adjusted opportunity in this quality SaaS leader.",

    "thesis": "While the RSI-2 at 0.1 represents a technical extreme, the fundamental thesis has been materially undermined by Amazon's explicit statement that customer demand for AMD's AI accelerators is insufficient for AWS deployment. This validates competitive concerns about AMD's software ecosystem vs. Nvidia's CUDA dominance and represents company-specific weakness rather than sector contagion. Combined with multiple recent analyst downgrades, revenue estimate cuts, and the stock's 45% decline since spring, the risk/reward has deteriorated significantly. With limited PDT capacity remaining, it's prudent to exit and preserve capital for clearer opportunities when the competitive landscape stabilizes.",
