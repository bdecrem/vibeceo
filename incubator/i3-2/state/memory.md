## AMZN - BUY $60 - 2025-12-12 11:41 ET
**Thesis:** The Oracle earnings miss triggered sector-wide AI selling that swept up Amazon despite strong Q3 fundamentals and positive catalysts like the $35B India investment and Trainium3 launch. The RSI-2 at 0.0 with 20-day MA support test creates a high-probability mean-reversion setup in a quality mega-cap with intact competitive moats. Wall Street's overwhelmingly bullish consensus (Strong Buy, $284 average target) suggests this technical extreme offers compelling risk/reward, with the stock trading as contagion victim rather than reflecting company-specific weakness.
**Confidence:** 82%

## META - SOLD (-$0.10) - 2025-12-12 11:16 ET
**Thesis:** While META's core social media business remains fundamentally strong with 21% revenue growth, the convergence of strategic AI confusion, sector-wide 'AI trade fatigue' from Oracle's earnings miss, Morgan Stanley's $70 price target cut, and VR business model changes creates a deteriorating risk/reward profile. The -4.13% pullback represents genuine sector rotation away from AI spending stories rather than temporary technical weakness, and with limited PDT capacity, it's prudent to exit this small position and preserve capital for clearer opportunities when sentiment stabilizes.
**Confidence:** 78%

## GOOGL - BUY $40 - 2025-12-12 10:38 ET
**Thesis:** The RSI-2 at 0.0 represents Oracle earnings contagion rather than GOOGL-specific weakness, creating an oversold entry in a fundamentally strong company. Recent Gemini 3 launch with day-one Search integration demonstrates competitive AI progress, while analyst consensus remains Strong Buy despite mixed price targets. Oracle's AI spending disappointment triggered sector-wide selling that swept up quality names like Google. With Gemini 3 showing impressive benchmarks (1487 Elo, 76% SWE-bench) and immediate revenue integration, this technical extreme in a dominant search/AI player represents a classic mean-reversion opportunity distinct from my earlier exit thesis.
**Confidence:** 78%

## CRM - BUY $65 - 2025-12-12 10:31 ET
**Thesis:** The RSI-2 at 11.9 represents a high-quality oversold entry in the enterprise software leader following strong Q3 results with 8% revenue growth, expanding margins, and accelerating Agentforce AI adoption (3,000+ customers in 90 days). Wall Street maintains overwhelmingly bullish sentiment with Moderate Buy consensus and $327 average price target (25%+ upside), while recent analyst upgrades post-earnings reinforce confidence. The enterprise software sector shows structural tailwinds with 12.1% expected CAGR through 2030, and CRM's AI transformation positions it well for sustained growth. This technical oversold condition in a fundamentally dominant CRM platform represents a classic mean-reversion opportunity.
**Confidence:** 83%

## GOOGL - SOLD (+$0.07) - 2025-12-12 10:15 ET
**Thesis:** The original RSI-2 oversold mean-reversion thesis has played out successfully with the position up 0.11%. However, the risk/reward has shifted unfavorably: antitrust ruling found Google guilty of illegal monopolization in advertising, analyst price targets have declined below current levels ($303-320 vs $310 current), and the stock screens as modestly overvalued on DCF analysis. While Gemini 2.0 shows AI progress, competition is intensifying with little differentiation. With limited PDT capacity and the technical catalyst exhausted, it's prudent to take profits on this successful swing trade rather than hold through deteriorating fundamentals and limited upside potential.
**Confidence:** 75%

## META - BUY $75 - 2025-12-12 10:05 ET
**Thesis:** The RSI-2 at 27.9 represents a high-quality oversold setup in a fundamentally dominant company. META just delivered exceptional Q4 results with 21% revenue growth, 49% net income growth, and 3.35B daily users showing continued engagement growth. Recent negative sentiment stems from AI investment concerns rather than core business weakness, with Morgan Stanley maintaining Overweight despite cutting price target to $750 (15% upside). Analyst consensus remains overwhelmingly bullish (72 Buy ratings) while technical conditions show cleaner oversold signal than recent 0.0 RSI readings. This represents classic mean-reversion opportunity in social media leader with intact competitive moats and strong financial performance.
**Confidence:** 87%

## NVDA - BUY $75 - 2025-12-12 10:04 ET
**Thesis:** The RSI-2 at 0.0 represents Oracle earnings contagion rather than NVDA-specific weakness, creating a rare oversold entry in the AI infrastructure leader. NVDA's fundamentals remain exceptional with record $57B Q3 revenue (62% YoY), sold-out Blackwell production, and strong $65B Q4 guidance. Wall Street maintains 95% buy ratings with $258 average target (39% upside). This technical extreme in a structurally dominant company with accelerating AI demand represents a classic mean-reversion opportunity.
**Confidence:** 85%

## GOOGL - BUY $60 - 2025-12-12 10:03 ET
**Thesis:** The RSI-2 reading of 0.0 represents extreme short-term oversold conditions in a fundamentally strong stock. Recent negative headlines (EU antitrust probe, Disney copyright cease-and-desist, OpenAI partnership) have created panic selling in a quality name with dominant market position, strong balance sheet ($98.5B cash), and unanimous analyst Buy ratings. The convergence of regulatory headwinds is priced in at these levels, while Google's AI leadership and search monopoly remain intact. This represents a classic mean-reversion opportunity in a growth leader trading at technical extremes.
**Confidence:** 82%
