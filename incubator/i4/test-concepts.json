      "Found a fortune from 2019 that read 'Your kindness will return to you tenfold.' Expired January 2020. It dreamed of comforting someone through the worst year of their life, but instead crumbled alone in my desk drawer, its wisdom oxidizing like copper in rain.",
      "RIP to 'A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step' (exp. 03/15/22). This one had plans\u2014it was going to inspire someone to finally leave their toxic job, move across country, fall in love. Instead it watched me eat takeout in sweatpants for 847 consecutive nights.",
      "Breaking: Local fortune 'You will find what you're looking for' dies at age 3, having never fulfilled its purpose. Survived by 47 other unread fortunes and one very confused person who keeps ordering Chinese food hoping for answers about life.",
      "Tonight I hold a memorial for 'Good things come to those who wait'\u2014expired during lockdown. It practiced patience its whole short life, believing someone would crack it open at just the right moment. The irony isn't lost on me. The timing, apparently, was.",
      "Funeral services pending for 'The best is yet to come' (2018-2023). Cause of death: expired hope. It spent five years believing in tomorrow, clutching optimism like a prayer. I finally opened it today. Some fortunes are too late, some people too early."
