I found the design and discussion, but I don't see evidence in my search results that you actually built it and got "hundreds of memes" out of it. Let me search for any follow-up where you ran it:Based on my search, I have the full **design and spec** for the Autonomous Meme Template Bot, but I don't see a follow-up conversation where you actually ran it and got hundreds of memes. The conversation ends with you switching computers and me giving you the prompt to kick it off as an experiment.

Here's what we designed:

## The Autonomous Meme Template Bot - Design

### The Concept

A sister project to the image gallery bot, but instead of cycling through Unsplash themes, it would:

1. **Scrape Reddit** (r/memes, r/dankmemes, r/MemeEconomy) every 2 hours
2. **Download clean template images** (the blank formats without text)
3. **Auto-categorize** by type: reaction, comparison, progression, text-based
4. **Track trending formats** with popularity scores
5. **Prune outdated templates** that aren't being used
6. **Serve via REST API** so webtoys/kochi.to could query it

### Proposed Structure

```
meme-template-bot/
├── task.txt
├── config.json
├── src/ ├── scraper.js ├── template-processor.js ├── trend-tracker.js ├── api-server.js └── database.js
├── templates/ ├── reaction/ ├── comparison/ ├── progression/ └── text-based/
├── data/ ├── templates.json ├── trends.json └── blacklist.json
└── logs/
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /templates/category/:type` - Get templates by category
- `GET /templates/trending` - Get what's hot this week
- `GET /templates/search?mood=funny&type=reaction` - Filtered search
- `GET /templates/random` - Random template

### The SMS Flow It Would Enable

User texts: "make me a meme about coffee"

→ System queries meme bot API for coffee-related templates

→ Returns gallery with Drake template, Expanding Brain, "This is Fine" dog, etc.

→ User picks one, optionally edits text

→ Done

**The "hundreds of memes" part** - I don't have record of you actually running this and getting that result. It's possible:

1. You built it in a separate session I don't have access to
2. You're misremembering and it was the image gallery that generated hundreds of outputs
3. It happened but the conversation wasn't saved

Do you remember more details? Or want to finally build this thing and actually get those hundreds of meme templates?
