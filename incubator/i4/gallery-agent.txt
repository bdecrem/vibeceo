Let me pull up more details from that conversation.Now I have the full picture. Here's the detailed overview:

## The Autonomous Image Gallery Bot - Your First Agent

### The Concept

You asked me "what's an agent and let's make one." I designed a system that would run continuously without human intervention - a **self-operating photo curator** that:

1. Picks a theme from a queue (nature photography → architecture → street art → minimalist design → vintage cars)
2. Searches Unsplash for images matching that theme
3. Downloads them
4. Generates a styled HTML gallery page
5. Rotates to the next theme
6. Repeats forever, every 30 minutes

The "agent" part was that Claude Code would read a `task.txt` instruction file and autonomously execute the workflow, handle errors, and even fix its own code if something broke.

### The Config (Topic Queue)

```json
{
 "currentTopic": "nature photography",
 "topicQueue": [
 "architecture",
 "street art", 
 "minimalist design",
 "vintage cars"
 ],
 "maxImages": 6,
 "unsplashAccessKey": "YOUR_KEY",
 "galleryTemplate": "modern"
}
```

After each run, the system would rotate: nature → architecture → street art → etc., cycling back around.

### The task.txt (Agent Instructions)

This was the key file that made it an "agent" - Claude Code would read this and know what to do:

```
AUTONOMOUS IMAGE GALLERY BOT

MAIN TASK:
1. Read config.json for the current topic
2. Search for 5-10 images related to the topic using Unsplash API
3. Download images to /images folder
4. Generate an HTML gallery in /galleries folder
5. Log all activities
6. If any step fails, diagnose and fix the issue
7. Update config.json with next topic from the queue

ERROR HANDLING:
- If API fails, retry with different search terms
- If download fails, skip that image and continue
- If gallery generation fails, use a simpler template
- Always log errors and solutions

SELF-IMPROVEMENT:
- Check logs for recurring issues
- Suggest code improvements in journal.md
- Keep the system running autonomously
```

### The Autonomous Runner

`run-autonomous.sh` would:
- Run Claude Code in headless mode every 30 minutes
- Health check every 5 minutes between runs
- Automatic error recovery
- Log all decisions to `autonomous-decisions.log`

---

### What Made It "Agent-Like"

1. **Self-directing**: Read instructions, made decisions
2. **Self-healing**: If something broke, it would attempt fixes
3. **Continuous**: Ran indefinitely without human input
4. **Stateful**: Tracked where it was in the topic queue
5. **Observable**: Logged everything for audit

---

### The Output

Each run generated:
- A themed HTML gallery with a dark theme and lightbox viewer
- An `index.html` listing all galleries
- Activity logs with timestamps
- Decision logs showing what Claude Code chose to do

This was August 2025. You've since built way more sophisticated agents (YouTube search, crypto reports, the whole kochi.to SMS system), but this gallery bot was the "hello world" that got you started with the pattern: config + instructions + autonomous loop + self-correction.
