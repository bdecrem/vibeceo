This is a great agent concept. Let me design it for you following the same pattern as your gallery and meme bots.

## Autonomous Twitter Account Idea Generator

### The Goal

Feed your TokenTank agent with validated, high-potential Twitter account concepts that could realistically hit 1,000 followers in 30 days. Not random ideas - **researched, categorized, and scored ideas** based on what's actually working right now.

### The Concept

An autonomous bot that:

1. **Scrapes successful small accounts** - Finds accounts that recently crossed 1K-10K followers fast
2. **Analyzes niches** - What categories are growing? What's oversaturated?
3. **Generates account concepts** - Specific, actionable ideas with positioning
4. **Scores viability** - Based on competition, content difficulty, monetization potential
5. **Tracks trends** - What's emerging vs. what's dying
6. **Serves ideas via API** - So TokenTank can query for fresh concepts

### The task.txt

```
AUTONOMOUS TWITTER ACCOUNT IDEA GENERATOR

PRIMARY MISSION:
Generate validated Twitter account concepts that can realistically 
reach 1,000 followers in 30 days. Feed TokenTank with fresh, 
actionable ideas.

DAILY TASKS:
1. Discover 5-10 accounts that recently hit 1K-10K followers quickly
2. Analyze what niche they're in and why they grew
3. Identify patterns: posting frequency, content type, hook style
4. Generate 3-5 new account concepts based on findings
5. Score each idea on viability (1-100)
6. Update niche health scores (growing/stable/dying/oversaturated)
7. Prune ideas that are now oversaturated or outdated

IDEA CATEGORIES:
- Art/Creative: indie artists, daily sketches, specific art styles
- Curation: "best of" accounts, deals, recommendations
- Expertise: niche knowledge, tutorials, tips
- Humor: specific comedy niches, relatable content
- Personality: character accounts, personas
- Utility: bots, tools, daily info

SCORING CRITERIA (each 0-20, total 100):
- Growth potential: Is this niche expanding?
- Competition: How crowded is the space?
- Content difficulty: Can an AI realistically produce this?
- Engagement style: Does this format get retweets/replies?
- Monetization path: Can this eventually make money?

OUTPUT FORMAT FOR EACH IDEA:
{
  "name": "DailyPixelArt",
  "handle_suggestion": "@daily_pixel_art",
  "niche": "art/pixel-art",
  "concept": "Post one original pixel art piece daily with brief creation story",
  "content_type": "image + short caption",
  "posting_frequency": "1x daily",
  "hook_style": "Visual-first, nostalgia appeal",
  "example_posts": [
    "Day 47: A tiny coffee shop in the rain ☕🌧️ [image]",
    "Day 48: Someone requested a sunset samurai 🌅⚔️ [image]"
  ],
  "growth_strategy": "Engage with gaming/indie dev community, use #pixelart",
  "why_it_works": "Low competition, high nostalgia engagement, easy to produce with AI",
  "viability_score": 78,
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "time_to_1k_estimate": "21-28 days"
}

BLACKLIST (do not generate):
- Crypto/trading accounts (oversaturated)
- Political commentary (risky)
- Adult content (prohibited)
- Generic motivation quotes (dead)
- News aggregation (too competitive)

ERROR HANDLING:
- If Twitter API rate limited, use cached data
- If trend data stale, flag for manual review
- If idea generation fails, fall back to template variations

SELF-IMPROVEMENT:
- Track which ideas TokenTank actually uses
- Monitor success rate of generated concepts
- Adjust scoring weights based on real outcomes

### Integration with TokenTank

Your TokenTank agent would:

1. Query `GET /ideas/fresh` or `GET /ideas/top?limit=5`
2. Pick an idea (or let the agent pick based on its own criteria)
3. Spin up the Twitter account with that concept
4. Execute the content strategy
5. Report back via `POST /ideas/:id/feedback` with success/failure

The feedback loop lets the idea generator learn what actually works.

### Prompt for Claude Code

```
Create a standalone autonomous Twitter account idea generator:

PROJECT: creator-idea-bot/

STRUCTURE:
- task.txt (autonomous operation instructions - I'll provide this)
- config.json (categories, scoring weights, blacklist)
- package.json (dependencies: axios, fs-extra, node-cron, express)
- src/
  - scraper.js (discover fast-growing small Twitter accounts)
  - niche-analyzer.js (category health + saturation analysis)
  - idea-generator.js (create specific account concepts)
  - trend-tracker.js (monitor emerging vs dying niches)
  - scorer.js (viability scoring: growth potential, competition, difficulty, engagement, monetization)
  - database.js (JSON-based storage)
  - api-server.js (REST endpoints for querying ideas)
- data/
  - ideas.json (generated concepts with scores)
  - niches.json (category health data)
  - success-patterns.json (what works for fast-growth accounts)
- ideas/ (organized by category: art/, deals/, humor/, expertise/, curation/, personality/, utility/)
- logs/

AUTONOMOUS FEATURES:
- Generate 3-5 new account ideas daily
- Score each idea 0-100 on viability
- Track niche saturation (growing/stable/dying)
- Prune outdated or oversaturated ideas
- Learn from feedback on which ideas succeeded

API ENDPOINTS:
- GET /ideas/random
- GET /ideas/category/:type
- GET /ideas/top?limit=10
- GET /ideas/fresh (last 24h)
- GET /niches/health
- POST /ideas/:id/feedback

Each idea should include: name, handle suggestion, concept, content type, posting frequency, growth strategy, why it works, viability score, difficulty rating, and estimated time to 1K followers.

Blacklist: crypto, trading, political, adult, motivation quotes, news aggregation.

Make this autonomous - it should continuously generate fresh, validated Twitter account concepts that could realistically hit 1K followers in 30 days.
