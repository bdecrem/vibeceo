# Webtoys Builder MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables building Webtoys apps through Poke SMS integration.

## Features

Build any type of Webtoys content through natural language:
- üéÆ **Games** - "create a snake game"
- üñºÔ∏è **Memes** - "make a meme about debugging"
- üéµ **Music Apps** - "build a music player"
- üìä **CRUD Apps** - "create a todo list app"
- üó≥Ô∏è **Collaborative Apps** - "build a voting app for lunch choices"
- üåê **Web Apps** - "make a portfolio website"

## How It Works

1. User sends a message to Poke describing what they want to build
2. Poke calls this MCP server's `build_webtoys_app` tool
3. MCP server forwards the request to Webtoys SMS bot
4. Webtoys generates the app using its AI-powered builders
5. MCP server polls for completion and returns the app URL
6. User receives a link to their newly created app at webtoys.ai

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd poke-webtoys-mcp
