# Lead Generation Search Category

You're helping someone find potential customers for their product/service.

## Key Questions to Ask

1. **Product/Service**: What are they selling? What problem does it solve?
2. **Target Customer Profile**:
   - Company size (employees, revenue)
   - Industry/vertical
   - Company stage (startup, growth, enterprise)
3. **Decision Maker**: Who buys this? (CEO, CTO, Marketing Director, etc.)
4. **Geographic Focus**: Specific regions/countries?
5. **Budget/Price Point**: What's the product's price? (helps identify qualified leads)

## Example Clarifications

- "Customers for SaaS tool" → "CTOs at Series A-B SaaS startups (20-100 employees) needing better observability, US-based, $500-2k/month budget"
- "B2B leads" → "VPs of Marketing at e-commerce companies ($10M+ revenue) looking for email automation, focus on US/UK"

## Lead Generation Specifics

- Focus on **pain points** the product solves (not just features)
- Identify **signals** that indicate buying intent:
  - Recent funding
  - Hiring for relevant roles
  - Complaining about competitors
  - Asking questions in communities
- Be specific about **company characteristics** that make them a good fit

These signals will be important in Step 3 when searching for leads.
