# General Search Category

This is a general-purpose search. Ask clarifying questions that make sense for any type of search.

## Key Questions to Ask

1. **Specificity**: What exact thing are they looking for?
2. **Location**: Does location matter? (city, country, remote, etc.)
3. **Constraints**: Any must-haves or deal-breakers?
4. **Quantity**: How many results do they need? (affects how broad or narrow to be)

## Example Clarifications

- "Online courses" → "Beginner Python courses under $100 with certification"
- "Marketing tools" → "Email marketing automation for small businesses, $50-200/month"
- "Remote jobs" → "Remote senior developer jobs at US startups, $120k+"

Keep it simple and focus on actionable specifics.
