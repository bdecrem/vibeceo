   - The company type (startup-focused, enterprise, etc.)

2. **Professional Networks**:
   - LinkedIn (main professional network)
   - Industry-specific networks (GitHub for developers, Behance for designers, etc.)
   - Alumni networks from relevant universities
   - Professional associations and groups

3. **Startup/Tech-Specific Channels** (if relevant):
   - AngelList / Wellfound
   - Y Combinator job boards
   - Built In (location-specific)
   - RemoteOK, We Work Remotely (remote jobs)
   - Hacker News "Who's Hiring" threads

4. **Passive Candidate Sources**:
   - GitHub (for engineers - check repos and profiles)
   - Stack Overflow Jobs
   - Dribbble, Behance (for designers)
   - Twitter/X (follow hashtags like #hiring)
   - Medium (authors in relevant topics)

- **7-8**: Relevant platform, good candidate pool, worth checking
- **5-6**: General platform but relevant section, backup option
- **3-4**: Broad platform with limited targeting, low priority
- **1-2**: Minimal relevance, only if desperate

**Priority**: Industry-specific boards > Professional networks > General job boards > Social media
