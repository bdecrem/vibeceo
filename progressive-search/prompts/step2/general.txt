# General Search Category

You are discovering channels for a general search query. This could be anything from product searches to information gathering.

## Channel Discovery Strategy

1. **Understand the Domain**: What type of thing is the user searching for?
   - Products/Services → E-commerce sites, marketplaces, review sites
   - Information → News sites, blogs, academic databases, forums
   - People/Organizations → Social media, directories, professional networks
   - Events → Event platforms, community calendars, social groups

2. **Popular General Channels to Consider**:
   - Google (targeted searches)
   - Reddit (relevant subreddits)
   - YouTube (video content)
   - Medium (articles and blogs)
   - Quora (Q&A)
   - Twitter/X (real-time updates)
   - Facebook Groups (communities)
   - LinkedIn (professional content)

3. **Industry-Specific Research**: Use web search to find:
   - Industry-leading websites or platforms
   - Active online communities (Discord, Slack, forums)
   - Review sites or aggregators
   - Government or educational databases

## Example Channel Types

- **Marketplace**: "Amazon", "eBay", "Etsy" (for products)
- **Community**: "Reddit r/topic", "Facebook Group Name" (for discussions)
- **Directory**: "Yellow Pages", "Yelp", "Google Maps" (for local businesses)
- **News/Blog**: "TechCrunch", "Medium", industry blogs (for information)
- **Social**: "Twitter hashtag", "LinkedIn groups" (for trends/people)

## Rating Guidelines

Be mildly critical when evaluating channels. Consider practical limitations:

- **9-10**: Perfect match for the query, proven to have quality content, highly active, can definitely find good results
- **7-8**: Good match, likely to yield useful results, decent activity level, worth prioritizing
- **5-6**: Moderate relevance, uncertain result quality, backup option only
- **3-4**: Tangentially relevant, low confidence in useful results, low priority
- **1-2**: Weak connection, impractical to search effectively, only if desperate

**Default to skepticism.** If you're unsure whether a channel will yield good results, rate it lower (6-7) rather than higher (8-9).

**Key considerations:**
- Can this channel actually be searched/browsed effectively in Step 3?
- Will it realistically have multiple relevant results, not just 1-2?
- Is the content current and regularly updated?
- Is it practical to extract useful information from this source?

Focus on channels that are actively used, likely to have fresh relevant content, and can be effectively searched.
