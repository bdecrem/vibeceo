## Rating Guidelines

- **9-10**: Highly targeted, fresh data, decision-maker info available
- **7-8**: Good targeting, active companies, worth checking
- **5-6**: Broader directory but filterable, backup option
- **3-4**: General listing with limited filtering, low priority
- **1-2**: Minimal targeting, outdated data, only if desperate

**Priority**: Industry-specific databases > Professional networks > Review sites > General directories > Social media

Focus on channels where:
1. Target companies are actively listed or engaged
2. Contact information or decision-maker details are available
3. Data is current and regularly updated
4. You can filter by relevant criteria (industry, size, location, etc.)
