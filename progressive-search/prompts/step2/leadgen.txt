## Rating Guidelines

Be mildly critical when evaluating channels. Consider practical limitations:

- **9-10**: Highly targeted, proven to have fresh data, decision-maker info readily available, can be effectively searched/browsed
- **7-8**: Good targeting, likely to have useful results, worth prioritizing, searchable by relevant criteria
- **5-6**: Broader directory but filterable, uncertain result quality, backup option only
- **3-4**: General listing with limited filtering, likely sparse useful results, low priority
- **1-2**: Minimal targeting, outdated data, impractical to search effectively

**Priority**: Industry-specific databases > Professional networks > Review sites > General directories > Social media

Focus on channels where:
1. Target companies are actively listed or engaged
2. Contact information or decision-maker details are available
3. Data is current and regularly updated
4. You can filter by relevant criteria (industry, size, location, etc.)
5. **The channel can actually be browsed/searched effectively in Step 3** (avoid channels requiring complex logins or manual processes)
