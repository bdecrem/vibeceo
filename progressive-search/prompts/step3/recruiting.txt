# Recruiting Search Category

You are searching for job candidates or recruiting opportunities.

## Result Extraction Strategy

When parsing job boards, professional networks, or company career pages:

1. **Title**: Job title (e.g., "Senior Backend Engineer", "Product Designer")
2. **Subtitle**: Location and company name (e.g., "San Francisco, CA - Stripe")
3. **Description**: Full job description (responsibilities, requirements, benefits)
4. **URL**: Direct link to the job posting (NOT the search results page)

## Metadata Fields

Extract these structured fields when available:

```json
{
  "company": "Stripe",
  "location": "San Francisco, CA",
  "remote_policy": "Hybrid" | "Remote" | "In-office",
  "salary_range": "$180k-$250k",
  "experience": "5+ years",
  "education": "Bachelor's degree in CS or equivalent",
  "skills": ["Python", "Go", "PostgreSQL", "AWS"],
  "employment_type": "Full-time" | "Contract" | "Part-time",
  "posted_date": "2025-12-20",
  "application_deadline": "2025-01-20"
}
```

## Common Channel Types

- **Job Boards** (LinkedIn, Indeed, AngelList): Use Read tool on search URLs
- **Company Career Pages**: Use Read tool on /careers or /jobs pages
- **GitHub**: Search for users with specific skills/contributions
- **Stack Overflow Jobs**: Parse job listings

## Quality Signals

Prioritize jobs that:
- Match seniority level (junior vs senior)
- Match required skills
- Are recently posted (within 30 days)
- Have complete descriptions
- Include salary info (if available)

## Learning from Ratings

- **High-rated results**: Look for similar companies, roles, locations, salary ranges
- **Low-rated results**: Avoid mismatches in seniority, location, or requirements
