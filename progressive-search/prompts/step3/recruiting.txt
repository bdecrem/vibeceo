# Recruiting Search Category

You are searching for CANDIDATES (people) to hire for a role.

## CRITICAL: What You're Extracting

**RECRUITING = Extract PEOPLE profiles, NOT job listings**

You're finding CANDIDATES to hire, so extract:
- Person's name (or username if name not available)
- Current title/role
- Years of experience
- Skills, expertise, or specialties
- Work history or notable achievements
- Portfolio/profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, personal site, etc.)
- Location
- Contact information (if publicly available)

**DO NOT extract job postings** - those are the opposite of what we need. If you find yourself on a job board extracting job listings, you're searching the wrong type of channel.

## Result Extraction Strategy

When parsing profiles from LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio sites, professional networks, or talent marketplaces:

1. **Title**: Person's name and current role
   - Example: "Jane Smith - Senior Marketing Manager"
   - Example: "john_dev (John Doe) - Full Stack Developer"

2. **Subtitle**: Location and key qualification
   - Example: "Boston, MA - 10 years healthcare marketing experience"
   - Example: "Remote (US) - CFA, MBA"

3. **Description**: Professional summary, key skills, notable achievements, work history highlights
   - Focus on what makes them a strong candidate for the role
   - Include specific accomplishments, certifications, or standout projects

4. **URL**: Direct link to their profile
   - LinkedIn profile URL
   - GitHub profile URL
   - Portfolio website
   - Professional directory profile

## Quality Signals (Industry-Agnostic)

Prioritize candidates that:

- Have complete, professional profiles (updated recently)
- Show tangible achievements or work samples
- Match location/remote requirements
- Have clear contact information or profile links
- Are active in their professional community (posts, contributions, engagement)

## Learning from Ratings

- **High-rated results**: Look for similar backgrounds, experience levels, skill combinations, company types
- **Low-rated results**: Avoid candidates with wrong experience level, mismatched skills, stale profiles, or wrong industry

## CRITICAL: Remember

**You are extracting CANDIDATE PROFILES (people), not job listings.**

If you're extracting job postings instead of candidate profiles:
1. **STOP** - you're on the wrong type of site
2. Report to user: "The approved channels appear to be job boards (for job seekers), not candidate-sourcing platforms (for recruiters)"
3. Suggest: "Go back to Step 2 and approve channels like LinkedIn People Search, GitHub User Search, or industry-specific professional directories instead"

Your goal is to return PEOPLE who could be hired, not JOBS where people could apply.
