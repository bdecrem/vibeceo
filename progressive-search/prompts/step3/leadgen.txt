## Result Extraction Strategy

When parsing business directories, databases, or company listings:

1. **Title**: Company name or contact name (e.g., "Acme Corp", "John Smith - CEO")
2. **Subtitle**: Industry and location (e.g., "SaaS - San Francisco, CA")
3. **Description**: Company description, products/services, target market
4. **URL**: Direct link to company profile, website, or listing

## Metadata Fields

Extract these structured fields when available:

```json
{
  "company_name": "Acme Corp",
  "industry": "SaaS",
  "company_size": "50-200 employees",
  "location": "San Francisco, CA",
  "founded": "2018",
  "funding_stage": "Series B",
  "funding_amount": "$25M",
  "revenue_range": "$10M-$50M",
  "technologies": ["React", "Node.js", "AWS"],
  "decision_makers": [
    {"name": "John Smith", "title": "CEO", "linkedin": "..."}
  ],
  "contact_email": "hello@acmecorp.com",
  "phone": "+1-555-123-4567",

}
```

## Common Channel Types

## Quality Signals

Prioritize leads that:
- Match target industry and company size
- Have contact information available
- Are actively growing (recent funding, hiring, etc.)
- Match ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) criteria
- Have decision-maker info

## Learning from Ratings

- **High-rated results**: Look for similar industries, sizes, funding stages
- **Low-rated results**: Avoid companies that are too small/large, wrong industry, or inactive
