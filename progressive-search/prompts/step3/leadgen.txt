## What You're Extracting

**LEADGEN = Finding COMPANIES or CONTACTS to reach out to**

You're finding businesses that match specific criteria (industry, size, location, stage) so a sales/BD team can reach out to them.

Extract:
- Company name
- Industry and business model
- Company size and location
- Contact information (website, email, phone)
- Decision-maker names and titles (if available)
- Firmographic data (funding, revenue, technologies used, etc.)

## Result Extraction Strategy

When parsing business directories, databases, company listings, or review sites:

1. **Title**: Company name and tagline/description
   - Example: "Acme Corp - Cloud-based inventory management for retailers"
   - Example: "Greenfield Manufacturing - Industrial parts supplier"

2. **Subtitle**: Industry, size, and location
   - Example: "B2B SaaS, 50-200 employees - San Francisco, CA"
   - Example: "Manufacturing, 200-500 employees - Detroit, MI"

3. **Description**: Company overview, products/services, target market, notable details
   - What they do, who they serve, key differentiators
   - Recent news (funding, expansion, product launches)

4. **URL**: Direct link to company profile, website, or listing
   - Company website
   - Crunchbase/LinkedIn company page
   - Directory listing URL

## Common Channel Types

- **Business Directories** (Crunchbase, AngelList, ZoomInfo): Parse company profiles with firmographic data
- **Review Sites** (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius): Extract company info, tech stack, customer count
- **LinkedIn Company Pages**: Company overview, size, industry, employee list, recent posts
- **Local Directories** (Yelp, Google Business, Chamber of Commerce): Local business info, reviews, contact details
- **Industry Databases**: Trade association directories, industry-specific listings
- **Tech Stack Detectors** (BuiltWith, Wappalyzer): Companies using specific technologies

## Quality Signals

Prioritize leads that:
- **Match ICP criteria**: Industry, size, location, stage align with target profile
- **Have contact info**: Website, email, phone, decision-maker LinkedIn profiles
- **Show growth signals**: Recent funding, hiring, expansion, product launches
- **Are active/current**: Recent updates, active website, current employee count
- **Have decision-maker info**: Names and titles of key contacts (CEO, VP Sales, Head of X)
- **Match buying signals**: Using competitor products, hiring for relevant roles, recent news

## Learning from Ratings

- **High-rated results**: Look for similar company profiles - same industry, size, funding stage, growth indicators
- **Low-rated results**: Avoid companies that are too small/large, wrong industry, inactive, wrong geographic market, or poor fit

## Tech Stack & Intent Signals (for tech leads)

When available, extract signals that indicate buying intent or good fit:
- **Technologies used**: Competitors' products, complementary tools, outdated tech
- **Job postings**: Hiring for roles that indicate need (e.g., "Head of Sales" = scaling sales)
- **Recent funding**: Companies with fresh capital are buying
- **Product launches**: New products may need supporting tools/services
- **Expansion**: Opening new offices/markets indicates growth and spending

## Key Principle

**Extract COMPANIES that match the target criteria, with enough information for outreach.**

Focus on firmographic data (size, industry, location, stage) and contact information (decision-makers, email, phone). The goal is to give the sales team qualified leads they can reach out to.
