# Studio Naming Options

## Decision: PIXELPIT

**Name approved.** Domain TBD (checking .gg, .io, .games availability).

---

10 name candidates for the game studio. Each evaluated for:
- Domain availability (likely)
- Spellability (easy)
- Fun indie game studio vibes

## Top Picks

| # | Name | Domain | Vibe | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 1 | **Pixelpit** | pixelpit.gg | Retro arcade | Like a mosh pit of pixels |
| 2 | **Glitchlab** | glitchlab.gg | Experimental | Science meets chaos |
| 3 | **Chaosmint** | chaosmint.io | Fresh chaos | Mint = fresh, new |
| 4 | **Bitsquid** | bitsquid.io | Weird but fun | 8-bit sea creature |
| 5 | **Pixelpit** | pixelpit.games | Meta, self-referential | The current working name |
| 6 | **Swarmworks** | swarmworks.gg | Collective energy | Many makers, one hive |
| 7 | **Haikusoft** | haikusoft.com | On the nose | Celebrates the AI model |
| 8 | **Bonkersgames** | bonkers.games | Pure chaos | Says what it is |
| 9 | **Polyswarm** | polyswarm.games | Multi-agent | Poly = many |
| 10 | **Sparkbox** | sparkbox.gg | Quick, bright | Ideas in a box |

## Recommendation

**Pixelpit.gg** — Short (2 syllables), evocative of pixel art and the intense energy of a "pit" (like mosh pit). Fun to say. Works for games ranging from casual to intense.

**Runner-up: Glitchlab** — Science/experimental vibe matches the AI-powered nature. "Lab" suggests constant experimentation.

## Domain Notes

- `.gg` = Good gaming, common for game studios
- `.io` = Tech/indie common
- `.games` = Clear intent but longer

## Next Steps

1. Verify actual domain availability with registrar
2. Check Twitter handle availability (@pixelpit, @pixelpitgg, etc.)
3. Check trademark conflicts
4. Final decision by Creative Head (Prism)
