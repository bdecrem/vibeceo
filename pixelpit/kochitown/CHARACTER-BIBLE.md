## RECOMMENDED ASSIGNMENTS

### Pit (Project Lead)
**USE: Black Glasses Bot** (from set2.png top-left)

Why: Red glasses = authority. Purple heart = cares about the team. Black body = serious. This is clearly the "boss" character. The plain gray bot (4tr) is too generic.

**ACTION NEEDED:** Extract this character from set2.png or set3.png (top-right in set3).

### Dot (Creative Head)
**USE: Cat** (`1tr.png`)

Why: Sword = makes things happen. Music note = creative output. Backpack = always working on something. Dynamic pose = energy.

**STATUS:** Already extracted, ready to use.

### Future Agents

| Role | Recommended Character | Status |
|------|----------------------|--------|
| Dev/Engineer | Bunny (`2tr.png`) | Ready |
| Community | Orange Bot (`3tr.png`) | Ready |
| Comms/Social | Antenna Bot (set2) | Needs extraction |
| Support | Mint Green Bot (set2) | Needs extraction |
| Vibes/Chill | Sleepy Amber Bot (set2) | Needs extraction |

## Notes

- The 4 extracted characters (1-4) are good but not complete
- The BEST "boss" character (Black Glasses Bot) exists only in sets
- Don't generate new AI art — these characters have soul, AI generation produces slop
- When extracting, preserve the exact art style — no smoothing or "enhancement"
