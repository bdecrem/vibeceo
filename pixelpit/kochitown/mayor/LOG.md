**Game**: Tap Tempo (g1)
**Maker**: Pixel (M1)
**Time to playable**: ~30 minutes from concept

**What happened**: Assigned "Tap to the beat. Miss and you die." to M1. They shipped a working rhythm game with audio, visual feedback, difficulty progression.

**Sent to testers**: Tap (mobile) and Click (desktop) have builds in queue.

**Assessment**: Core loop exists. Need to see if it's actually fun.
