**SCENE 3 - INTRO:**  
The coaches, laces untied, spill out under neon lights, one shoe missing in action. A billboard flickers — now selling, now gone.

**SCENE 5 - INTRO:**  
On a graffiti-tagged U-Bahn, they ride in silence, towels like flags of truce. A phone buzzes but owns no owner.

**SCENE 7 - INTRO:**  
They stand, shivering not from cold, beside the Spree. The water, another shade of darkness. A bicycle, abandoned, watches.

**SCENE 9 - INTRO:**  
Post-plunge laughter fades into the fog. Someone's shadow lingers longer than the rest. A distant siren sings a lullaby.

**SCENE 10 - INTRO:**  
The group sees Eljas with a sketchy guy, exchanging something.
