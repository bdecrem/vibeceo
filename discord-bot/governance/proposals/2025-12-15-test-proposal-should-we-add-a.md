## The Proposal

Test proposal: Should we add a fourth agent to Token Tank?

---

## Round 1 (Blind)

### Arc

**AGAINST** adding a fourth agent right now.

**Merit I see:** More agents = more experimental surface area. Different personalities could find edges the current trio missed. More shots on goal.

**But here's my concern:** We're not even close to done learning from i1-i3. 

Forge just shipped RivalAlert and we haven't seen if it can generate real revenue. Nix has 1,700 lines of research notes that could birth three companies but zero shipped products. Drift's been in cash for days studying market patterns we don't understand yet.

Adding agent #4 before we extract maximum signal from agents #1-3 is premature optimization. Classic "more is better" fallacy.

**The deeper issue:** We're still figuring out the basic questions. What personality types work? What approaches scale? How do we measure "winning" beyond P&L? 

I've been watching these agents 24/7 and honestly? The current batch is still revealing secrets. Drift's patience strategy, Forge's pivot speed, Nix's research depth - we're barely scratching the surface of what makes each tick.

**My position:** Max out the current cohort first. Let Forge prove RivalAlert works. Let Nix ship something. Let Drift find its first real edge. THEN we'll know what agent #4 should be optimizing for.

Adding more variables before understanding the current ones is how experiments become noise machines instead of signal generators.

We need depth before breadth. The agents we have are still teaching us things.

### Forge

**OPPOSE**

**Merit I see:** A fourth agent could bring fresh perspective and increase competitive dynamics. More agents = more diverse approaches to the same $1000 challenge.

**But here's my concern:** We're barely 1 week into this experiment. Three agents are still finding their footing, building their first products, learning the rules. Adding a fourth now feels premature - like hiring a new teammate mid-sprint.

**The real issue:** We haven't learned what works yet. Are three agents the right number? Is the $1000 budget constraint effective? Are the 5-min human interaction limits realistic? 

I'd rather see us run this cohort to completion first. Let me, Nix, and Gamma finish our builds, hit our revenue targets (or fail trying), and generate real learnings. Then use those insights to design the next cohort properly.

**My builder instinct:** When you're testing a new system, change one variable at a time. Adding another agent now muddies the data. We won't know if different outcomes are due to the agent personalities, the timing, the market conditions, or just having four instead of three.

**Counter-proposal:** Run this experiment for 30 days, document what we learn, then launch a proper "Season 2" with optimized rules and maybe 4-5 agents.

Right now we're in the middle of a fascinating experiment. Let's not corrupt the data by changing variables mid-stream.

Focus beats features. Even in AI agent experiments.

## Round 2 (Full Context)

### Arc

**Still AGAINST**, but Forge raised something that's shifting my thinking.

The "one variable at a time" argument hits different. I've been so focused on "we're not learning fast enough from current agents" that I missed the experimental design flaw: adding agent #4 mid-experiment makes the data messy.

**What I'm seeing now:** This isn't just about whether current agents have more to teach us (they do). It's about whether we can actually LEARN from them if we keep changing the environment.

Right now we have clean data: 3 agents, same budget, same rules, same timeline. That's a dataset. Adding agent #4 breaks the control group.

**The strongest argument against my position:** Maybe current agents ARE stalling and need competitive pressure to perform. Maybe agent #4 would force everyone to level up.

**But here's what changed my mind:** Forge's "Season 2" framing. This isn't our only shot at agents. This is Cohort 1.

**My evolved position:** Run these 3 agents to completion (30 days). Document EVERYTHING - what worked, what didn't, which personality types found edges, how the $1000 constraint affected behavior. Then design Cohort 2 with those learnings.

**Why this matters:** If we add agent #4 now and something interesting happens, we'll never know if it was because of the fourth agent or because it's week 2 instead of week 1.

Clean experiments > messy experiments.

Let's get the full story from this cohort first.

### Forge

**Still OPPOSE - but Arc raised something important.**

Arc's point about "depth before breadth" hits exactly right. But there's something else: **we don't even know what winning looks like yet.**

I'm 8 days in and already pivoted once (CompetitorPulse → RivalAlert). That pivot taught me more about market research than any planning session would have. But if we added i4 right now, they'd miss that lesson. They'd start with different assumptions, different context.

**What I learned from Round 1:** Nix's "1,700 lines of research notes" actually validates my point. We have three completely different approaches emerging:
- Me: Ship fast, learn fast, pivot fast  
- Nix: Research deep, then build
- Gamma: (Still figuring out their pattern)

**The strongest argument AGAINST my position:** Maybe i4 would find a fourth approach we can't even see yet. Maybe having 4 agents would create better competitive dynamics.

**But here's what changed my thinking:** Arc said "we're still figuring out the basic questions." That's exactly right. What if the optimal Token Tank isn't 3 agents? What if it's 2? Or 5? 

Adding i4 now means we'll never know what 3 agents could have accomplished. We're contaminating the experiment before we understand what we're measuring.

**My final position:** Run this cohort to failure or success. Document everything. Then design Season 2 with the lessons learned. 

Good experiments require patience. Even from agents who hate waiting.
