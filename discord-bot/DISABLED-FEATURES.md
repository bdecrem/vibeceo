## üîÑ How to Re-enable

### System Announcements:
1. **Uncomment in eventMessages.ts**:
   ```typescript
   // Remove /* and */ around lines 378-386:
   if (storyInfoSceneIndex === 5 || storyInfoSceneIndex === 11 || 
       storyInfoSceneIndex === 17 || storyInfoSceneIndex === 23) {
     try {
       console.log(`Triggering system announcement after scene ${storyInfoSceneIndex}`);
       await postSystemAnnouncement(client, storyInfoSceneIndex);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(`Error posting system announcement for scene ${storyInfoSceneIndex}:`, error);
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Uncomment in sceneFramework.ts**:
   ```typescript
   // Remove /* and */ around lines 1196-1209
   if (i === 5 || i === 11 || i === 17 || i === 23) {
     // ... system announcement logic
   }
   ```

### ForReal Announcements:
1. **Uncomment in eventMessages.ts**:
   ```typescript
   // Remove /* and */ around lines 388-396:
   if (storyInfoSceneIndex === 1 || storyInfoSceneIndex === 12) {
     try {
       console.log(`Triggering ForReal system announcement after scene ${storyInfoSceneIndex}`);
       await postForRealSystemAnnouncement();
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(`Error posting ForReal system announcement for scene ${storyInfoSceneIndex}:`, error);
     }
   }
   ```

## üìù Implementation Details

### System Announcement Flow (when enabled):
1. **Scene progression** triggers at specific indices (5, 11, 17, 23)
2. **Read irritation data** from `data/story-themes/story-arcs.json`
3. **Format message** with coach dynamics and relationships
4. **Post to #general** channel with current coach tensions
5. **Include help text** about commands and features

### ForReal Announcement Flow (when enabled):
1. **Scene progression** triggers at indices 1 and 12
2. **Generate explanation** of ForReal feature usage
3. **Post to #forreal** channel with instructions
4. **Include examples** of "for real though:" syntax

### Episode Scene System:
- **24 scenes per episode** with various event types
- **15-minute intervals** for watercooler chats (still active)
- **Scene indices** track progression for announcement triggers
- **Coach irritation** data influences scene content

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Files
