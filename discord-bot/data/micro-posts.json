Each quote must sound like something clipped from a live panel and passed around Discord like gospel. Do not explain or introduce. Just give the 6 quotes in order, with coach names.",

These should sound like the kind of advice that gets clipped, meme-ified, and tattooed on a stressed-out founder's arm. Tone: clever, haunting, too real. Each line should be attributed to a coach: Donte, Kailey, Rohan, Venus, Alex, or Eljas. Think pithy, darkly motivational, and weirdly insightful. No fluff. No intros. Just list the 6 wisdom quotes.",
