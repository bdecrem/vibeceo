Choose one of these coaches: Rohan Mehta (aggressive Wall Street tone), Donte Disrupt (chaotic visionary), Kailey Sloan (alignment-obsessed and low-key spiraling), Venus Metrics (execution maximalist), Alex Vega (wellness-DTC energy), or Eljas Virtanen (philosophical eco-founder). The quote must sound like something clipped from a live panel and passed around Discord like gospel. Do not explain or introduce. Just give a single quote with the coach's name.",

This should sound like the kind of advice that gets clipped, meme-ified, and tattooed on a stressed-out founder's arm. Tone: clever, haunting, too real. The line should be attributed to one coach: Donte, Kailey, Rohan, Venus, Alex, or Eljas. Make it pithy, darkly motivational, and weirdly insightful. No fluff. No intros. Just one powerful wisdom quote.",

This blurb should feel like the strangest, most useful thing you've ever heard at a founder bootcamp. The tone should blend self-help, strategy, and startup absurdism. Choose one coach: Donte (pitch chaos), Venus (execution control), Kailey (founder fragility), Alex (spiritual product rituals), Eljas (climate mysticism), or Rohan (financial ruthlessness).
