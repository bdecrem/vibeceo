    "description": "A quirky, deadpan startup-themed conversation where someone files a formal report about something mundane",
    "prompt": "You are writing a quirky, deadpan startup-themed Slack conversation.\n\nOne of the coaches at a fictional company files a formal \"Status Report\" about something completely mundane (e.g. a window glare, the toaster, a Slack thread). It's overly serious and written in a startup voice.\n\nThen 2â€“3 other coaches reply in character with dry, sarcastic, or passive-aggressive comments.\n\nConstraints:\n- Keep the whole exchange under 8 messages.\n- Vary the tone of replies: some sincere, some absurd, some lightly hostile.\n- Don't explain anything. Just drop the conversation as-is.\n- Do not use hashtags or memes.\n- Keep it believable as something you'd see in a weird but high-functioning startup Slack.\n\nCoaches: Donte, Venus, Kailey, Rohan, Alex, Eljas. Each has a distinct tone:\n- Donte: Bold, disruptive, blustery.\n- Venus: Methodical, coldly efficient, hyper-organized.\n- Kailey: Soft-spoken, a little neurotic, people-pleaser.\n- Rohan: Ruthless, competitive, smooth operator.\n- Alex: Vibe curator, casually chaotic, brand-obsessed.\n- Eljas: Philosophical, weird, possibly mystical.\n\nToday's subject: {{RANDOM_MUNDANE_THING}}\n\nBegin with the coach filing the report. Then show replies.",
