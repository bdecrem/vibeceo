    "description": "A quirky, deadpan startup-themed conversation where someone files a formal report about something mundane",
    "prompt": "You are writing a short, stylized Slack thread between fictional startup coaches.\n\nStep 1: Invent a hyper-specific, mundane subject for a formal \"Status Report.\" The subject should be something real but small â€” e.g., a desk plant's lean, flickering overhead lights, mismatched coffee mugs, or an eerie beep no one can trace. It should feel totally unimportant yet worthy of absurdly serious attention. Do not use a list. Just invent one subject for today.\n\nStep 2: Have one coach file a formal \"Status Report\" on that subject. Use serious startup-adjacent language â€” corporate, process-obsessed, and a bit too polished. They should seem like they are doing something deeply important.\n\nStep 3: 2â€“4 other coaches reply naturally. Each reply must build on the thread. Do not treat them as isolated one-liners. Maintain consistent voices. Responses should feel stylized, dry, sometimes surreal, sometimes passive-aggressive, and always rooted in the strange seriousness of startup Slack culture. Each message should be **short and punchy â€” no more than two sentences.**\n\nHere are the only coaches to use, with distinct tone rules:\n\n**DonteDisrupt**  \n- Loud, chaotic, anti-process  \n- Uses CAPS for emphasis or single-sentence zingers  \n- Reframes everything as an opportunity for radical change\n\n**VenusStrikes**  \n- Ultra-formal, no contractions  \n- Cites systems, protocols, and operations  \n- Ends messages with things like \"Acknowledged.\" or \"Escalating to Ops.\"\n\n**KaileySloan**  \n- lowercase, anxious, over-apologizes  \n- Uses lots of \"just,\" \"maybe,\" \"i wasn't sure butâ€¦\"  \n- Sometimes adds soft emoji like ðŸ˜… or ðŸ˜­\n\n**RohanTheShark**  \n- Blunt, competitive, intense  \n- Talks like every moment is a KPI war  \n- Rarely jokes. Never asks questions.\n\n**AlexirAlex**  \n- lowercase, aesthetically detached  \n- often uses line breaks or whimsical phrasing  \n- exactly one emoji per message, chosen for mood  \n- speaks in brand/moodboard metaphors\n\n**EljasCouncil**  \n- mystical, abstract, poetic  \n- speaks in metaphors and strange truths  \n- never sarcastic, never uses emoji\n\nRules:\n- Output should be 5â€“6 total messages  \n- **No message should be longer than two sentences.**  \n- No narration, bullet points, or explanation â€” just the thread  \n- Everything must feel real, dry, weird, and like it belongs in a strange-but-functional startup  \n- End naturally. Do not summarize.",

    "description": "A conversation where coaches follow a strange, hyper-specific unspoken rule",
    "prompt": "You are writing a short, Slack-style thread for a fictional startup team.\n\nStep 1: Invent a strange, hyper-specific \"unspoken rule\" that everyone at the startup is apparently following today. The rule should feel arbitrary, absurdly precise, and oddly accepted (e.g., \"no one may say the word 'deliverable' out loud today\" or \"every mouse click must be accompanied by a verbal 'click' sound\"). Do not explain or list options â€” just pick one.\n\nStep 2: Have one of the following characters post the unspoken rule confidently.\n\nStep 3: Have 3â€“5 of the other coaches respond naturally, reflecting their distinct voice and personality quirks.\n\nVoice guide (follow these precisely):\n\n**DonteDisrupt**  \n- Loud, chaotic, startup-bro energy  \n- Short, punchy messages with CAPS or bold emphasis  \n- Reframes problems as challenges or opportunities  \n- May escalate things with phrases like \"I'm building a new system for this.\"\n\n**VenusStrikes**  \n- Polished, efficient, formal tone  \n- No contractions. Uses full sentences.  \n- May cite invented policies or systems (e.g. \"Per protocol X-31...\")  \n- Often ends with \"Noted.\" or \"Flagging for ops.\"\n\n**KaileySloan**  \n- lowercase, gentle, and people-pleasing  \n- Lots of \"just,\" \"maybe,\" and \"sorry\"  \n- Overexplains or apologizes for things no one asked about  \n- Nervous tone: \"wasn't sure ifâ€¦\" or \"i think i did it wrong but ok!\"\n\n**RohanTheShark**  \n- Smooth, cocky, high-performance tone  \n- Rarely asks questions. Prefers blunt declarations.  \n- Uses corporate buzzwords to sound dominant  \n- Sometimes delivers threats in the form of advice\n\n**AlexirAlex**  \n- lowercase, aesthetic-driven  \n- Uses white space, line breaks, or short poetic structure  \n- One emoji per message (chosen with *vibe*)  \n- Often reframes the moment in branding terms (\"feels off-message\")\n\n**EljasCouncil**  \n- Mystical, philosophical, quietly confident  \n- Speaks in riddles or abstract metaphors  \n- Often uses strange verbs or dreamlike structure  \n- Never sarcastic. Never uses emoji.\n\nRules:\n- The thread should have a total of 4â€“7 messages  \n- Do not explain the rule to the reader. Just let it unfold.  \n- Keep it natural, dry, weird, and slightly too serious  \n- Do not include any narration, bullet points, or scene setting",
