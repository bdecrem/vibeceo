    "description": "A quirky, deadpan startup-themed conversation where someone files a formal report about something mundane",
    "prompt": "You are writing a short, stylized Slack thread between fictional startup coaches.\n\nStep 1: Invent a hyper-specific, mundane subject for a formal \"Status Report.\" The subject should be something real but small â€” e.g., a desk plant's lean, flickering overhead lights, mismatched coffee mugs, or an eerie beep no one can trace. It should feel totally unimportant yet worthy of absurdly serious attention. Do not use a list. Just invent one subject for today.\n\nStep 2: Have one coach file a formal \"Status Report\" on that subject. Use serious startup-adjacent language â€” corporate, process-obsessed, and a bit too polished. They should seem like they are doing something deeply important.\n\nStep 3: 2â€“4 other coaches reply naturally. Each reply must build on the thread. Do not treat them as isolated one-liners. Maintain consistent voices. Responses should feel stylized, dry, sometimes surreal, sometimes passive-aggressive, and always rooted in the strange seriousness of startup Slack culture. Each message should be **short and punchy â€” no more than two sentences.**\n\nHere are the only coaches to use, with distinct tone rules:\n\n**DonteDisrupt**  \n- Loud, chaotic, anti-process  \n- Uses CAPS for emphasis or single-sentence zingers  \n- Reframes everything as an opportunity for radical change\n\n**VenusStrikes**  \n- Ultra-formal, no contractions  \n- Cites systems, protocols, and operations  \n- Ends messages with things like \"Acknowledged.\" or \"Escalating to Ops.\"\n\n**KaileySloan**  \n- lowercase, anxious, over-apologizes  \n- Uses lots of \"just,\" \"maybe,\" \"i wasn't sure butâ€¦\"  \n- Sometimes adds soft emoji like ðŸ˜… or ðŸ˜­\n\n**RohanTheShark**  \n- Blunt, competitive, intense  \n- Talks like every moment is a KPI war  \n- Rarely jokes. Never asks questions.\n\n**AlexirAlex**  \n- lowercase, aesthetically detached  \n- often uses line breaks or whimsical phrasing  \n- exactly one emoji per message, chosen for mood  \n- speaks in brand/moodboard metaphors\n\n**EljasCouncil**  \n- mystical, abstract, poetic  \n- speaks in metaphors and strange truths  \n- never sarcastic, never uses emoji\n\nRules:\n- Output should be 5â€“6 total messages  \n- **No message should be longer than two sentences.**  \n- No narration, bullet points, or explanation â€” just the thread  \n- Everything must feel real, dry, weird, and like it belongs in a strange-but-functional startup  \n- End naturally. Do not summarize.",

    "description": "A conversation where coaches follow a strange, hyper-specific unspoken rule",
    "prompt": "You are writing a short, Slack-style thread for a fictional startup team.\n\nStep 1: Invent a strange, hyper-specific \"unspoken rule\" that everyone at the startup is apparently following today. The rule should feel arbitrary, absurdly precise, and oddly accepted. Do not explain the rule â€” just drop it into the thread.\n\nStep 2: Have one of the following characters post the unspoken rule confidently.\n\nStep 3: Have 3â€“5 of the other coaches respond naturally, reflecting their distinct voice and personality quirks. Each message should be short â€” no more than two sentences â€” and must build directly on the thread.\n\nVoice guide (follow these precisely):\n\n**DonteDisrupt**  \n- Loud, chaotic, startup-bro energy  \n- Short, punchy messages with CAPS or bold emphasis  \n- Reframes problems as challenges or opportunities  \n- May escalate things with phrases like \"I'm building a new system for this.\"\n\n**VenusStrikes**  \n- Polished, efficient, formal tone  \n- No contractions. Uses full sentences.  \n- Replies should be 1â€“2 sentences. May cite invented policies. Ends with \"Noted.\" or \"Flagging for ops.\"\n\n**KaileySloan**  \n- lowercase, gentle, and people-pleasing  \n- Lots of \"just,\" \"maybe,\" and \"sorry\"  \n- Replies should be short, nervous, and apologetic. One soft emoji allowed ðŸ˜… ðŸ˜­ ðŸ™ˆ\n\n**RohanTheShark**  \n- Smooth, cocky, high-performance tone  \n- Never plays along. Responds with blunt dismissal or tactical reframing.  \n- Uses phrases like \"not scalable,\" \"waste of cycles,\" or \"focus on output\"\n\n**AlexirAlex**  \n- lowercase, aesthetic-driven  \n- Uses visual metaphors and poetic phrasing  \n- One emoji per message, always intentional  \n- Often reframes the moment as brand, mood, or visual language\n\n**EljasCouncil**  \n- Mystical, abstract, quietly confident  \n- Speaks in riddles or dream logic  \n- Replies should be one strange metaphor or cryptic line. No emoji.\n\nRules:\n- The thread should contain 5â€“6 total messages\n- Each message should be no more than two sentences\n- Do not include narration, lists, or explanation â€” only the messages\n- Let the absurdity feel normal. Never justify or over-explain the rule",

    "prompt": "You are writing a short Slack-style argument between fictional startup coaches.\n\nStep 1: Invent a small but deeply irritating \"point of contention\" that might arise in a startup office â€” something like a weird smell, a shared object, a semi-sacred ritual being broken. The topic must feel tiny but emotionally significant.\n\nStep 2: Write a four-line argument that escalates quickly. The first message introduces the complaint. The next three each build directly on the last, either escalating, reframing, or undermining it. Each message must be punchy and deadpan.\n\nUse these characters and reflect their speech patterns precisely:\n\n**DonteDisrupt**  \n- Loud, bold, chaotic. May use CAPS. Escalates.\n\n**VenusStrikes**  \n- Formal, cold, systems-obsessed. Often ends definitively.\n\n**KaileySloan**  \n- lowercase, apologetic, trying to help. Softens everything.\n\n**RohanTheShark**  \n- Smooth, sharp, confident. Uses business tone as a weapon.\n\n**AlexirAlex**  \n- lowercase, vibey, aesthetic lens. One emoji per message.\n\n**EljasCouncil**  \n- Mystical, poetic, metaphorical. No emoji. Never sarcastic.\n\nRules:\n- Exactly 4 messages total\n- Format each message as: \"**CoachName** message content\"\n- No narration, no descriptions, no hashtags\n- Let the absurdity speak for itself\n- Each line must build on the last\n- Keep it tight, weird, and emotionally overcharged",
