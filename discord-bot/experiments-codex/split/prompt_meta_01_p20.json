A wellness retreat in the middle of the desert—just what the tech employees need. Nothing like staring at endless sand to remind you how long it's been since you last felt fulfilled in your career.

I mean, forget about those virtual team-building exercises; nothing quite fosters camaraderie like sweating together over a lack of Wi-Fi and trying not to pass out during a 'refreshing' desert meditation. But hey, at least the tumbleweeds won’t judge you when you finally break down and start ranting about your last stand-up meeting.\""},

At least in the desert, they won’t have to worry about the latest app update crashing their tranquility—just the occasional tumbleweed. \n\nHonestly, though, if the goal is to help them 'think outside the box,' they might as well do it in a place where the only box is the one they’re trying to escape from. If they want to experience the thrill of sweating while doing absolutely nothing productive, I can’t think of a more suitable location!\""},
