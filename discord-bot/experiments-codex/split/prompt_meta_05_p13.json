Here's how he might present it:\n\n---\n\n**Eljas Virtanen’s Pitch:**\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, let’s talk about food waste. It’s like the old saying goes: ‘Waste not, want not.’ But in today’s world, we seem to be wasting like it’s a competitive sport. Every year, billions of pounds of perfectly good food end up in landfills, and you know what that means? More methane than a middle school cafeteria’s ‘mystery meat Monday.’ \n\nNow, wouldn’t it be nice if we could turn that waste into something useful? Enter our service—where your leftovers become your next energy boost. Yes, we take the uneaten kale, the sad carrots, and those mysterious Tupperware inhabitants and transform them into energy drink supplements. Because who needs a full plate when you can just have a scoop of yesterday’s dinner in a bottle?\n\nImagine your friends’ faces when you say, ‘Oh, this energy drink? It’s made from my expired tomato sauce.’ They’ll either applaud your commitment to sustainability, or they’ll just take a step back and slowly back away. Either way, win-win!\n\nBut seriously, here’s the insight: In a world obsessed with convenience, we greenlight a lot of waste. What if we flipped the script? Instead of letting our food scraps haunt the trash can, we turn them into fuel for our bodies—because why not harness our culinary regrets into energy? \n\nAnd think about it: with our supplements, you can channel your inner superhero, all while being a champion for the environment. Plus, you’ll have a great conversation starter. ‘What’s your pre-workout routine?’ ‘Oh, you know, just blending last week’s casserole with a hint of existential dread.’ \n\nSo, let’s stop glorifying waste and start treating our leftovers like the resource they are. Because remember: if there’s one thing we’ve learned, it’s that food makes the world go ’round—and we’re here to make sure it spins a bit more sustainably. Thank you!”\n\n---\n\nWith his trademark wit, Eljas would effectively blend humor with a compelling argument for a sustainable future, making the pitch both entertaining and thought-provoking."},

Today, we’re diving into the deliciously ironic world of waste. You see, when life gives you lemons, you don’t just make lemonade; you turn it into a high-powered energy drink—preferably one that won’t stain your couch.”\n\n---\n\n**On the Process:**\n“People often ask me, ‘Eljas, how exactly do you make energy drinks from food scraps?’ Well, my friends, it involves a complex alchemy akin to turning lead into gold—but much less likely to end up in a medieval quest. We’re talking fruit peels, vegetable trimmings, and whatever else your fridge has kindly conspired to forget. Think of it as a culinary resurrection—but without the holier-than-thou attitude.”\n\n---\n\n**On Sustainability:**\n“Some may say we’re simply ‘upcycling’ food waste. I call it giving leftovers a second chance at life. It’s a bit like a midlife crisis for carrots—they thought they were done, but now they’re back in the game, energizing health enthusiasts everywhere.”\n\n---\n\n**Consumer Insights:**\n“Statistics show that 40% of food in the U.S. goes to waste. That’s basically like ordering a three-course meal and politely asking the waiter to throw half of it in the bin. What if instead, we served it back to you in a sparkly can? Instant health trend! ‘Sorry, kale, you’ve been replaced by yesterday’s broccoli.’”\n\n---\n\n**On Market Potential:**\n“Energy drinks are the modern-day fountain of youth, minus the dubious ethical implications of immortality. The market is booming, and we’re here to infuse it with some serious sustainability. Imagine it: energy drinks that not only fuel your workout but also come with a side of moral superiority. ‘Oh, you thought my drink was just delicious? It’s saving the planet, too. What’s your beverage doing, Chad?’”\n\n---\n\n**Closing Thoughts:**\n“So, as we embark on this journey from waste to taste, remember that our mission isn’t just to quench your thirst; it’s to sip the future without the hangover of guilt. Grab a can of sustainability; it’s a party where the punch is made from yesterday’s salad, and everyone is invited—unless you’re a food snob. In that case, we have a special blend just for you: it’s called ‘Get Over Yourself.’”\n\n---\n\nBy interspersing humor with insightful commentary, Eljas Virtanen makes the pitch both engaging and thought-provoking, appealing to the audience’s desire for innovation and sustainability."},

Here’s how he might frame the presentation:\n\n---\n\n\"Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we’re tackling a pressing issue: food waste. You know, that thing that’s crammed in the back of your fridge and might just be plotting a takeover? While most people see leftover pizza as a tragedy waiting to happen, we see it as an opportunity. An opportunity to turn yesterday's forgotten dinner into tomorrow's energy drink supplements. Because who doesn't want to channel their inner compost bin, right?\n\nNow, you might be thinking, 'Eljas, turning food waste into energy drinks sounds... interesting, but do I really want to be sipping on something that was once a wilted salad?' Well, my friends, in a world where kale can cost more than your phone bill, we have to ask ourselves: why not? \n\nThe truth is, food waste is like an uninvited guest at a party—nobody wants to deal with it, but we all know it’s there, lurking behind the expired yogurt. Did you know that globally, we waste about one-third of all food produced? That’s a lot of leftovers we could reinvent! It's like the culinary version of living in a shoebox: if you mash it all together, you might just find something magical inside.\n\nSo, our solution? We take your expired apples, overripe bananas, and even that questionable Tupperware of mystery stew, and we transform them. Yes, we literally harness the energy from food that would otherwise end up in landfills and turn it into something that you can actually feel good about consuming. Think of it as circular economy meets liquid gold—only in this case, the gold is a hyper-caffeinated, slightly tangy energy supplement. \n\nAnd let’s not forget—every sip you take is like giving a gentle hug to Mother Earth. 'Sorry for dumping that pizza crust in the trash, but look at me now, I’m saving the planet one supplement at a time!' It's a feel-good story for our conscience and a deliciously ironic twist on sustainability.\n\nSo, raise your glasses—well, cups of our latest energy drink made from yesterday's dinner—because if we can't laugh at our food waste, we might as well drink it! Thank you!\"\n\n---\n\nEljas’s pitch would be a clever dance between humor and thought-provoking insights, leaving the audience both entertained and enlightened about the potential of transforming food waste into something beneficial."},

Here’s how he might present it:\n\n---\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today. I'm excited to introduce our groundbreaking service that takes your food waste and transforms it into energy drink supplements. Because, let’s face it, if you’re going to throw out your broccoli, it might as well grow up to be something somewhat respectable, like an energy drink.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: ‘Eljas, energy drinks are already the pinnacle of health and wellness.’ And I couldn’t agree more! Who wouldn’t want a beverage that combines the essence of your expired salad with the thrill of caffeinated chaos? But let’s shift focus to the real issue here: food waste. Did you know that nearly one-third of the food produced globally goes to waste? That’s like throwing away a perfectly good Tesla because you decided to bike to work instead. It’s just inefficient!\n\nImagine this: your leftover pizza becomes the fuel for your daily grind. Finally, all those late-night decision-making mistakes can be harnessed into something that gets you through your Monday morning meeting. Who knew yesterday's dinner could give you the energy to tackle today’s existential dread?\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: by turning our food waste into energy supplements, we’re not just saving the planet— we’re also keeping that guilt-inducing compost heap at bay. Because let’s be honest, nothing says ‘I care about the environment’ like a smelly pile of old food sitting in your backyard, right next to the ‘I recycle’ sign.\n\nSo, join us as we revolutionize the world of energy drinks! Let’s make sure that next time you sip on that vibrant concoction of kale and coffee grounds, you feel a little less guilty about what you didn’t eat. Waste not, want not—unless we’re talking about the calories from that leftover cake. Please, let’s not waste those.\"\n\n---\n\nWith his clever wordplay and insightful commentary, Eljas would effectively highlight the absurdity of food waste while promoting the innovative concept of turning it into something beneficial."},

You know, that stuff that ends up in landfills, smelling worse than a forgotten gym bag? Well, we’re here to change that narrative. Introducing “Waste Not, Want Not”—the only service that turns your food scraps into energy drink supplements. \n\n**Eljas looks around with a smirk:** \n\n\"Now, before anyone gets nervous, no, we’re not just blending your leftover takeout from last Saturday night. We’re talking about transforming food waste into something truly energizing and sustainable. Think of it as recycling for lazy people… because instead of sorting your trash, you can just drink it.\"\n\n---\n\n**The Insights:**\n\n1. **Sustainability Meets Nutrition:**\n   \"We’re living in a world where avocado toast is a lifestyle, but we throw away a third of our food. It’s like paying for a gym membership and then eating donuts on the treadmill. So why not utilize those discarded greens to fuel our workouts instead? Our energy drink supplements pack the nutrients you’d otherwise throw away into something that’ll help you crush that morning workout—or at least look good while trying.\"\n\n2. **The Power of Upcycling:**\n   \"You know, in art, they say, 'One person's trash is another person's treasure.' I’d like to think we’re taking that philosophy and applying it to beverage science. So, if you’ve ever wondered what would happen if your expired kale and overripe bananas had a baby, we’re here to bring that vision to life!\"\n\n3. **Taste – Not Just a Marketing Strategy:**\n   \"And for those worried about flavor... let's just say we’ve got our R&D team on speed dial. They’ve been working tirelessly to ensure that ‘banana-peel-pineapple’ doesn’t taste like something you scraped off the floor of a farmer’s market. Spoiler alert: It tastes better!\"\n\n4. **The Caffeine Dilemma:**\n   \"Why drink another cup of coffee when you could sip on a bottle of ‘Cabbage Charge’? It’s caffeine-free, but don’t worry—your heart will still race when you realize you can fuel your day without a single coffee bean being harmed in the process.\"\n\n---\n\n**Closing Thought:**\n\nSo, to summarize: we’re not just turning food waste into energy drinks; we’re saving the planet, supporting your fitness goals, and transforming the way we think about our food. And if you don’t buy into that, at least you can say you helped reduce the number of sad bananas in the world. \n\nRemember, if we can’t make a profit from our trash, at least we can make it less trashy. So who’s ready for a drink? \n\n---\n\n**Eljas takes a sip of the prototype, raises an eyebrow, and deadpans:** \n\n“Tastes suspiciously like innovation.” \n\nThank you!"},

I hope you’re ready for a pitch that’s as refreshing as a summer drink—because today, we’re not just quenching thirst; we’re quenching the guilt of our landfills.”\n\n[Pause for effect, letting the audience absorb the gravity of food waste.]\n\n“Now, let’s talk about food waste. You know, it’s the only thing that seems to multiply faster than my laundry pile after a week of procrastination. You’d think we’d learn by now—one day, we’re buying avocados like they’re going out of style, and the next day, they’re sulking in the back of our fridge, growing their own little eco-system.”\n\n[Audience chuckles.]\n\n“When we say, ‘Waste not, want not,’ we’re not just talking about our food. We're talking about a solution that transforms that very waste into a delicious energy drink supplement. Because why let perfectly good nutrients end up in the compost when they could be fueling your workout? It’s like turning broccoli into a muscle-building potion. And let’s be honest, which of us wouldn’t want to have a six-pack while feeling virtuous about our impact on the planet?”\n\n[Eljas gestures dramatically, inviting the audience into a comedic visual.]\n\n“Imagine if you will: you’re chugging down your energy drink, powered by the very food we deemed ‘not worthy’ of our dinner plates. Why? Because we love the thrill of living on the edge—except when it comes to vegetables, apparently. But we’re here to change that narrative. We’re taking the food that the stores rejected, the fruits that fell off their trees in rebellion, and turning them into something that makes you feel alive, alert, and undeniably smug. You can sip it knowing you’ve saved the planet, one nutrient-rich gulp at a time!”\n\n[He raises an eyebrow.]\n\n“Now, I can hear the skeptics in the audience: ‘Is this safe?’ Well, let me tell you, it’s not just safe; it’s exciting! It’s like playing food roulette but without the chance of salmonella. Our process ensures that every drop of liquid energy comes from the best bits of food waste. Think watermelon rinds, apple cores—no more whimsically tossing them away like yesterday’s news. Instead, they become your secret weapon against fatigue!”\n\n[Eljas leans in closer to the audience, lowering his voice for dramatic effect.]\n\n“And oh, the irony! Eating your waste to stay fit—it’s like a mother’s worst nightmare turned into a motivational quote. Remember the times your mom said, ‘Finish your vegetables, there are kids in Africa starving’? Well, now those very vegetables can fuel your workouts while saving the world. It’s a win-win! And those kids? They’ll be sipping on our energy drink too, basking in their own vegetable resurgence!”\n\n[He gestures to a projected image of the product, sleek and colorful.]\n\n“In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, while we can’t prevent every avocado from becoming guacamole fodder, we can give those sad, lonely produce pieces a second life. So say goodbye to food waste and hello to a leaner, greener, and certainly funnier way to energize your day! Trust me, the only thing that’ll be wasted here is your doubt! Let’s make our drinking habits as conscientious as our diets—together, we can transform leftovers into leg day!”\n\n[Eljas concludes with a cheeky salute, a satisfied grin on his face.]\n\n“So, ready to raise a glass to food waste? I promise, it’ll be one for the ages—or at least until the next food trend comes along.

Well, that may not be a bad thing for us!”\n\n*Slide 2: The Problem*\n\n“Did you know that one-third of all food produced globally ends up in the trash? It's like throwing money out of the window but with the added bonus of a lingering smell. Talk about a waste of good resources!

We’re literally taking ‘leftovers’ to a whole new level—because who knew turning yesterday's salad into today’s energy boost could be so chic? It’s like thrift shopping for your body. One person’s rotten apple is another person's natural energy source!”\n\n*Slide 4: The Science*\n\n“Now, let’s get a bit technical… but don’t worry, I won’t ask you to think too hard.

Yes, indeed! While most people would rather throw away their uneaten broccoli, we’re here to turn that broccoli into a powerhouse of energy. Who knew that the key to boosting your energy lay in the sad remnants of last week’s dinner?\n\nYou may ask, 'Why food waste?' Well, let’s face it: in a world where we’re throwing away nearly a third of the food we produce, we figured, why not give desperation a chance? After all, if you can’t eat your greens, why not drink them? They say necessity is the mother of invention; I say, hunger is the stepmother of desperation.\n\nPicture this: Instead of composting that handful of wilted spinach, you can now sip it while contemplating your life choices. I mean, what better way to show your kale who’s boss than turning it into an energy supplement that packs a punch and a dash of guilt? \n\nAnd just think about the branding opportunities! Our slogan could be: ‘Waste Not, Want Not – Because your leftover lasagna deserves better.’ We’ll have flavors that sound enticing: ‘Mediterranean Mystery’ or ‘Garden Gone Rogue.’ You won’t just be drinking a supplement; you’ll be embarking on a culinary quest filled with questionable dietary decisions.\n\nNow, for the skeptics in the room, I get it. You worry about the taste. Sure, we might have to work on the ‘Earthy Aftertaste’ – but isn’t that just a reminder of where your energy came from? Plus, if you’re not feeling energized after a sip, at least you’ll have a conversation starter: ‘Oh, this? It’s just last week’s pizza, reimagined.’\n\nSo why invest in my little venture? Because we believe in the power of recycling – not just paper and plastics, but food too! Who says waste can’t be a source of energy? After all, if the planet can survive on our mistakes, surely we can too.\n\nIn conclusion, join us in this splendid madness where every unwanted carrot and forgotten cucumber gets a second chance. Together, we won’t just reduce food waste – we’ll sip our way to a better tomorrow, one inconsiderate vegetable at a time.

You know, the other day I looked at my fridge and thought, 'Wow, this is the only place where leftovers get to be the stars of a sad, unappetizing reality show.' But fear not! We're not here to judge those aging tomatoes or the half-eaten pizza. We’re here to turn their tragic fate into something rather… invigorating.\n\nImagine this: We’re taking your wilted kale—a plant that somehow spent its entire life trying to be trendy—and transforming it into a refreshing energy drink. It’s like a superhero origin story, but instead of fighting crime, this kale will help you run that marathon you promised yourself you'd start training for… last year.\n\nNow, you might ask, ‘Why energy drinks?’ Well, let’s face it: caffeine isn’t the only thing keeping us awake these days.

I see some of you are wondering why we’re here. Is it about sustainability? Is it about innovation? Or is it just about finding a way to recycle grandma’s fruitcake? The answer is... all of the above.\n\nWelcome to *Waste Not, Want Not*—where we turn your expired veggies into, well, energy drinks! Yes, you heard right. While others toss their leftover kale, we're busy turning it into potent power boosts. Who knew those wilting greens could be your next pre-workout?\n\nNow let’s address the elephant in the room: food waste. According to studies, roughly one-third of all food produced is wasted. That’s a lot of perfectly good nutrients going down the garbage disposal of life. And some could say that's the real tragedy of our times—especially if you’ve ever faced a close encounter with a fridge at the end of its ‘use by’ period. \n\nYou might be skeptical: ‘Eljas, how can a drink made of old food be good for me?’ Well, I suggest you pair it with a blind taste test. You might find that our beetroot-infused energy drink tastes more like a victory sip than a compost heap. And don't get me started on the antioxidants—it’s like having a little army fighting off the free radicals in your body! \n\nPicture this: you open your fridge, and instead of reaching for that mysterious jar of pickles from 2015, you grab a can of our energy drink. You’ll be chugging down yesterday's news, quite literally! \n\nBut let’s not forget the real kicker here. For every drink sold, we’re also funding local farms to help them reduce their own waste. It’s like a beautiful circle of life… if that circle was made of repurposed mango peels and banana skins. Simba would be proud. \n\nSo, folks, as we embark on this exciting journey of turning waste into wonders, remember: one person’s expired food is another person’s energy drink. Because at the end of the day, why waste what can fuel our next adventure?\"\n\n---\n\nWith that blend of dry humor and insight, Eljas would surely leave the audience amused and intrigued by the innovative concept of turning food waste into energy supplements!"},

Here’s how he might elevate the presentation:\n\n---\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for gathering here today. As we all know, food waste is a growing problem. In fact, it’s so prevalent that if food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. And let’s face it, nobody wants to be associated with the third-place loser in the emissions game. \n\nNow, our innovative solution is quite simple: we’re transforming that food waste into energy drink supplements. It’s like turning the unwanted leftovers of last night’s dinner into the power-up you need for your morning jog. I don’t know about you, but I’ve always wanted my pre-workout to taste like guilt—well, now it can!\n\nThink about it. We’re taking that limp kale you bought because it was 'trendy' but then promptly forgot about in the back of the fridge, and we’re turning it into a refreshing energy supplement. It’s like a little tribute to your past self, reminding you that yes, you did have aspirations of being healthy… a little too late, perhaps.\n\nLet’s not forget the irony of it all. We live in a world where people are spending more on gym memberships than they do on groceries, yet we’re throwing away a significant portion of that food. It’s as if we’re all part of some twisted reality show called 'Survivor: The Grocery Aisle.' \n\nAnd while the average consumer sees an empty plate as a failure, we see potential! Our philosophy is simple: if life hands you lemons, make a supplement. Because frankly, who needs another lemon drop cocktail when you can have a lemon-infused workout boost that’s also saving the planet? \n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat it—well, actually, let’s! Because that’s precisely what we’re not doing. Our supplements are free from unnecessary additives and full of the goodness that would have otherwise gone straight to the landfill.\n\nIn conclusion, we’re not just fighting food waste; we’re redefining it. So, the next time you find yourself staring at a pile of unused produce, just remember: it’s not trash—it’s an untapped energy source. And together, we can turn that waste into something worth consuming. Or at least into something that will make you feel a little less guilty about your dinner choices.\n\nThank you, and remember, waste not, want not—especially when it comes to your energy levels!”\n\n--- \n\nWith his trademark wit, Eljas would not only highlight the environmental significance of the initiative but also engage the audience in a conversation about the absurdities of food waste, leaving them both informed and entertained."},

Instead of worrying about your 3 p.m. slump, you just sip on what used to be a week-old kale. Who knew feeling fueled could be a little... wilted?”\n\n2. **Waste Management:**\n   “They say one person's trash is another person's treasure. In our case, one person's waste is another person's workout supplement. So, if you see someone running at the gym with a smoothie made from yesterday's broccoli, just know they’re really going for that green energy vibe.”\n\n3. **Rebranding Food Waste:**\n   “We’ve all heard about the new wave of sustainability. Who would’ve thought that a compost pile could become a ‘performance-enhancing’ compost pile?

Here’s how he might present your food waste-to-energy drink supplement service:\n\n---\n\n\"Good afternoon, everyone. As we gather here to discuss a revolutionary approach to sustainability, let’s take a moment to appreciate the irony of our times. We’re living in an era where we throw away enough food to feed our entire planet several times over. Meanwhile, we’re busy innovating to create energy drinks that promise to give us the power of a thousand suns, yet we’re often just as lethargic as the food rotting in our bins.\n\nNow, imagine if we could transform that very waste into something invigorating. Yes, that’s right—turning discarded apples into your new favorite energy booster is not just our mission; it’s practically a public service. After all, if there’s one thing better than a caffeine rush, it’s a caffeine rush garnished with a side of guilt-free sustainability.\n\nLet’s talk numbers: in 2023, the world wasted about 1.3 billion tons of food. If that doesn’t sound like a buffet of missed opportunities, I don’t know what does. Our energy drink supplements come from food that would otherwise end up in a landfill, which is a win-win unless you’re a raccoon looking for a snack.\n\nSure, there will be skeptics. They’ll ask, 'Can I really get my energy fix from yesterday’s tomato salad?' To which I reply: 'Isn't it better than getting your energy from a neon-colored beverage that could double as paint thinner?'\n\nWe’re not just making drinks; we’re creating a movement. A movement where your ‘energy boost’ isn’t just legal caffeine consumption, but a hero’s journey back from the brink of the compost bin. We’re here to show that sustainability doesn’t have to be dull; in fact, it can be downright refreshing—like drinking a smoothie made of broccoli, if the broccoli had a better marketing team!\n\nAnd remember, folks, the next time you’re looking for a quick pick-me-up, ask yourself: are you ready to sip on the future? Because with our supplements, you’re not just energizing your day—you’re saving it from going to waste. \n\nSo let’s toast to a cleaner planet and to food that not only nourishes our bodies but keeps us buzzing with vitality.

Well, it turns out that broccoli and bananas have more energy potential than your average corporate team meeting. So, why not harness that energy for good? After all, we've long known that one person's trash is another person's treasure. In our case, it's more like one person's wilted lettuce is another person's pre-workout boost.\n\nIt's no secret that food waste is a massive problem. In fact, we throw away about a third of all food produced. Imagine if we could channel all that energy into something productive, like creating a drink that gives you the power to outrun your regrets—like that time you bought that expensive kitchen gadget that has never seen the light of day. \n\n‘Waste Not, Want Not’ is not just a charming phrase; it’s our company mantra. With every sip of our energy drink, you’ll not only feel invigorated but also morally superior.

Grab a cup, it’s a superfood!’ \n\nNow, let's address the elephant in the room: the taste. Fear not, we’ve done extensive testing. We’ve learned that just because it looks like a science experiment doesn’t mean it has to taste like one. With a careful blend of ingredients, we ensure that our drinks will leave you feeling refreshed—not feeling like you just chewed on a compost heap. \n\nSo, as we embark on this journey from waste to wellness, remember: every sip is a step toward sustainability—because with our product, ‘No one should ever drink alone, especially food waste.’ \n\nThank you, and let’s embrace a future where we can work out and save the planet—one unfashionable vegetable at a time!”\n\n--- \n\nEljas’ pitch, rich with dry humor and sharp insights, not only addresses the serious issue of food waste but also embraces the absurdity of the situation, making the audience consider both the product and its broader implications."},

Not me—at least, not until I visited my local compost heap.”\n\n“Let’s be honest, wasting food is just lazy—after all, those potatoes didn’t grow in a lab. They worked hard in the dirt, probably dreaming of a better life as mashed potatoes. We’re here to give them a second chance! If food can be resurrected into a drink that fuels your hustle, what’s stopping us? A little mold? Pfft! That’s just nature’s way of reminding us that some of the best ideas come from, well, ‘bad’ ideas.”\n\n“And sure, some might say turning food waste into an energy drink is ‘unorthodox.’ But honestly, nothing says ‘I value sustainability’ quite like sipping on a drink made from yesterday’s dinner. It’s not just eco-friendly; it’s eco-chic! You’ll be the trendsetter at the gym—who needs fancy labels when you can flaunt a bottle labeled ‘Rescue Blend’?”\n\n“In conclusion, with our innovative process, we’re not just saving the planet one drink at a time—we’re making food waste fashionable. Because if you’re going to waste something, it might as well be your preconceived notions about nutrition.

I’m Eljas Virtanen, and today I present to you a groundbreaking service that transforms food waste into energy drink supplements. Because who wouldn’t want to chug down some of last week’s wilted kale, am I right?”\n\n---\n\n**On Food Waste:**\n\n“Did you know that one-third of the food produced globally ends up in the trash? That’s not just a tragedy; it’s basically a buffet for landfills. If food could talk, I imagine it’d be screaming, ‘Waste not, want not!’ while still being too wilted to get a decent conversation going.”\n\n---\n\n**On Energy Drinks:**\n\n“Energy drinks are like promises made at 3 AM—full of empty calories and just as unsustainable. Why not replace them with something that’s actually got *substance*? Our supplements are like that one friend who invites you to dinner and then doesn't eat anything—totally reuses leftovers for a purpose.”\n\n---\n\n**On Sustainability:**\n\n“Some might say we’re just taking out the trash, but I prefer to think of it as our grand food resurrection project. We’re not just saving the planet; we’re making it stronger and more… caffeinated. If Mother Nature had a favorite drink, it would definitely be one made from repurposed broccoli.”\n\n---\n\n**On Market Potential:**\n\n“Now, I know what you’re thinking: 'Can I really drink my carrot peels?' Well, yes! And imagine the conversations that will spark at your next dinner party: ‘What’s in your drink? Oh, just the remains of my last attempt at eating healthy. Want some?’”\n\n---\n\n**On Health Consciousness:**\n\n“Let’s face it. These days, if you’re not drinking something with superfoods, are you even alive? Our energy drink supplements will not only help you power through your day but also allow you to feel morally superior while doing it. ‘Yes, I’m drinking yesterday’s vegetables. It’s very *on-trend*.’”\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n“In conclusion, let’s stop throwing food away and start throwing it back into our lives. With our service, you can literally drink to sustainability. You’ll not only feel energized—you’ll feel like a superhero saving the world, one sip of yesterday’s salad at a time. So who’s ready to toast to a future where food waste becomes our fuel?”\n\n--- \n\n**Q&A:**\n\n“I'm here to answer any questions—unless it’s about why kale constitutes the majority of our blend; that’s just a personal vendetta of mine.” \n\n--- \n\n*Eljas' pitch combines dry humor with sharp insights, taking the audience from laughter to understanding the underlying message: sustainability can come in unexpected forms, and even old food can have a bright future.*"},

Well, in our case, it’s one man’s spoiled bananas turned into an energy drink supplement. It’s a banana split you won’t regret—unless you mix it with the wrong ingredients. Then it’s just a split in your stomach.”\n\n*He smirks, letting the groans of laughter settle.*\n\n“Studies show that roughly a third of all food produced globally is wasted. That’s enough food to feed over 3 billion people. So, if you’ve ever felt guilty about your leftovers, just remember: you’re not just an eater; you’re a potential energy-generating powerhouse. Who knew your fridge had such a bright future?”\n\n*He gestures to a chart displaying food waste statistics.*\n\n“We’ve created a solution that not only tackles food waste but also gives you the energy to chase your dreams—or at least chase the ice cream truck down the street. Our energy drinks are made from food that would otherwise be left to rot in landfills, because let’s be real, nobody wants a smoothie that’s a week old. No one wants to be the person at the party who brings ‘aged’ food.”\n\n*With a dismissive wave, he continues.*\n\n“Our drinks are formulated to give you that extra boost without the aftertaste of regret—because who wants to survive the morning after on the taste of yesterday’s salad? Trust me, no one is riding on the ‘Day-Old Veggies’ train to success.”\n\n*He smiles knowingly at the audience, eyes twinkling with mischief.*\n\n\"Now, I know what you’re thinking: ‘Will this make me superhuman?’ Well, one can only hope. On the bright side, it will definitely keep you awake during those long meetings where everyone pretends to be engaged while secretly planning their dinner. And let’s face it, if the conversation veers towards avocado toast again, you might need that boost just to nod along.”\n\n*Eljas leans in, as though sharing a secret.*\n\n“And you know what else? If you snag one of our drinks, you can proudly say, ‘I’m saving the planet, one sip at a time!’ Just don’t ask me to explain how it works when your friend inevitably questions your choice of beverage. I mean, nobody wants to be the person who says, ‘It’s fermented kale!’ at a bar, right?”\n\n*He pauses, allowing the laughter to roll in.*\n\n“In conclusion, by investing in our service, you’re not just purchasing energy drinks; you’re investing in a sustainable future. You’re doing your part to turn waste into wellness—while making your taste buds sing and your conscience clear. If power napping could become a sport, we’d be champions. Until then, let’s fuel our days with food waste that’s anything but wasted!”\n\n*He grins, arms wide open, inviting the audience to join him in this journey of rediscovery—not just of food, but of humor in the face of waste.* \n\n“Remember, if life gives you lemons, make an energy drink and call it a day. Thank you!” *He bows exaggeratedly and exits the stage, leaving a trail of laughter and thought behind.*"},
{"prompt_id":"meta_05_p13","meta_id":"meta_05","completion_id":"meta_05_p13_c27","response":"Eljas Virtanen, known for his dry humor and keen insights, would approach the pitch with a blend of wit and sharp observation. Here’s how he might present it:\n\n---\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our grand unveiling of a revolutionary service that transforms food waste into energy drink supplements. Yes, you heard me right. We're talking about turning what you throw away into what you can now throw back. Because in today's world, if you're not recycling your bananas, are you really living?\n\nNow, let’s ponder for a moment the irony of our situation. We live in a time where people pay good money for energy drinks, while we waste more food than we can fit in a landfill. It’s like spending a fortune on a fancy restaurant meal just to promptly feed the bins outside. Think of us as the culinary metaphor for 'when life gives you lemons.' Except we’re taking those lemons and turning them into a hyper-caffeinated, vitamin-packed potion—without the guilt.\n\nYou might be wondering, who would actually drink a product made from food waste? Well, consider this: every sip would be packed with nutrients and perhaps even a hint of nostalgia for those overripe bananas you forgot on the counter. Our motto? 'Nourish the planet while you nourish yourself.' It’s like getting your daily dose of vitamins and saving the Earth, all in one gulp. Take that, smoothie shop.\n\nOf course, we’re not just selling energy drinks; we’re promoting a lifestyle—a lifestyle where you can feel heroic for sipping bioengineered smoothies made from yesterday's bread. Imagine the cocktail parties where you can regale your friends with tales of how you’re now part of the avant-garde of the circular economy. 'Oh, this energy drink? It used to be a carrot.' \n\nNow, while some might call it food waste, I like to refer to it as 'culinary potential.' Every moldy cucumber has a hidden destiny. And sure, it might not win any beauty contests, but as we say, 'One person’s trash is another’s energy drink!'\n\nSo, as we embark on this journey of sustainable hydration, remember: waste not, want not. Because if we don't start finding creative ways to use our leftovers, we might just end up having to pause before we say 'cheers' and take a moment to grieve the demise of that sad salad that didn’t make it through lunch.\n\nIn conclusion, let’s raise a glass—preferably one made from recycled materials—and toast to a future where our energy comes not just from what we consume, but from what we choose not to discard. Because as I always say, 'If life gives you scraps, make a supplement.' Thank you!\"\n\n--- \n\nWith this pitch, Eljas would not only charm the audience with his humor but also leave them with thought-provoking insights about sustainability, innovation, and the value of rethinking our relationship with food."},

When it comes to food waste, we all know the saying: ‘Waste not, want not.’ But I’d like to add, ‘Waste not, and you might just end up with a really strong energy drink!’”\n\n---\n\n**[Slide 2: The Problem with Food Waste]**\n\n**Eljas:** “Did you know that one third of all food produced is wasted?

It’s like alchemy, but instead of turning lead into gold, we’re turning yesterday’s salad into tomorrow’s endurance fuel. Who needs a philosopher’s stone when you have a blender?”\n\n---\n\n**[Slide 5: Health Benefits]**\n\n**Eljas:** “Our drinks are packed with vitamins, minerals, and—you guessed it—undisputed flavor. But don’t worry, even the pickiest drinkers won’t notice the asparagus in there. We could call it ‘Stealth Health’—perfect for those who want to hide their vegetables in plain sight.”\n\n---\n\n**[Slide 6: Environmental Impact]**\n\n**Eljas:** “Using food waste for energy drinks significantly reduces landfill contributions. Think about it: instead of tossing your leftovers into the trash, just imagine sipping your way to a greener planet.

We’re not just selling drinks; we’re selling a lifestyle choice. A choice to feel good about what you drink—and what you don’t throw away. Because nothing says ‘I care’ like drinking your salad.”\n\n---\n\n**[Slide 8: Conclusion and Call to Action]**\n\n**Eljas:** “So, join us in our quest to turn trash into treasure—or, as we like to say, turn ‘waste into haste.’ After all, who wouldn’t want to sprint to the fridge knowing they’re saving the planet one energy drink at a time?” \n\n---\n\n**[Final Slide: Thank You & Questions]**\n\n**Eljas:** “Thank you for your time! And remember, the next time you find yourself staring at that half-eaten apple, just think: it could be the next big thing in energy drinks. Now, who’s ready for a taste test of yesterday’s lunch?” \n\n---\n\n**[End of Presentation]** \n\nEljas delivers the pitch with dry wit and an insightful approach to the food waste dilemma, compelling the audience to see the humor and potential in sustainability."},

Here are a few lines he might share:\n\n---\n\n“Welcome to our service, where we transform your leftover kale into a refreshing energy drink. Because, let’s face it, wasting food is just too mainstream. Who needs a balanced diet when you can have a balanced energy drink featuring yesterday’s salad?”\n\n“Imagine the possibilities: one day, you might be sipping on a ‘Banana Peel Blitz’ while your friends are still painstakingly trying to find a way to get rid of their expired yogurt. We’re not just recycling; we’re elevating it to a new level of chic.”\n\n“Why do we throw away food? Is it really because it’s gone bad, or is it just an elaborate plot by our fridges to keep us from discovering the true essence of expired cabbage? With our drinks, we’ll not only conquer the food waste crisis but also give your taste buds a thrill ride—who knew ‘leftover soup’ could taste like ‘energy explosion’?”\n\n“Let’s not kid ourselves; you can’t spell ‘dysfunctional pantry’ without ‘fun.’ But fear not! With our innovative energy drinks, every sip is a reminder that even yesterday’s produce can be today’s fuel for your morning jog—or your Netflix binge. After all, who wants to waste energy worrying about what to do with their food scraps?”\n\n“Join us on this journey where your trash can becomes a treasure chest. Say goodbye to fear of mold and hello to 'Moldy Mango Madness.'

Also, our drinks are way more fun at parties.”"},

Yes, you heard it right! We’re transforming food waste into energy drink supplements. Who knew that yesterday's pizza could fuel your next marathon? \n\nYou see, in this world, we have two types of people: those who waste food, and those who make it into something miraculous.

But with our service, you can finally turn that shameful trophy into something you’d actually want to chug before hitting the gym.\n\nHere’s the kicker—it's not just about avoiding guilt at the buffet. By recycling our food waste, we’re not only reducing landfill waste but also pumping out energy drinks packed with nutrients that were once destined for the compost bin. Talk about a plot twist. Who knew your salad could fuel your workout? \n\n**(Pauses for effect)**\n\nI mean, do you really need another powdered drink promising to taste like a rainbow? Spoiler alert: it doesn’t.
