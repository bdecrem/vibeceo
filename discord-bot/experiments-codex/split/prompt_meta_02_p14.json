How would her selfies influence political alliances, or what if Shakespeare had a podcast instead of a play? Join us as we explore the absurdity of influencer culture today by drawing parallels with the lives of iconic historical figures!”\n\n2. **Concept Overview**:\n   “In each episode of 'Influence Through Time,' we analyze the lives and legacies of historical figures and compare their methods of influence to today's social media phenomenon.

Who doesn’t love a good scandal or a riveting story? History has plenty!”\n\n4. **Thought-Provoking Discussions**:\n   “We’ll not just entertain but provoke thought—what makes someone an influencer?

We’ll turn the podcast into a community forum around the ever-evolving idea of what it means to be an influencer.”\n\n6. **Visually Compelling Branding**:\n   “Visuals will play a key role—think bold, eye-catching artwork that draws inspiration from historical art but with a modern twist. We’ll create memes and sharable content for social media platforms to engage our audience and encourage them to share their favorite historical ‘influencers.’”\n\n7. **Call to Action**:\n   “If you’re curious about why society glorifies certain individuals and what that means for our culture, subscribe to 'Influence Through Time.'
