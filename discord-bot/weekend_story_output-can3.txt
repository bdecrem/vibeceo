The sky darkens over Berlin; a single shoe dangles from a lamppost. The group hesitates at a crosswalk.

**SCENE 5 - INTRO:**  
An Uber driver, lost in his own world, hums a discordant tune. Someone’s towel is already damp.

**SCENE 7 - INTRO:**  
Beside the Spree, a graffiti message reads “Echos are free”. Eljas pockets something quickly.

**SCENE 9 - INTRO:**  
Kailey stretches, mentioning the urgent need for espresso post-plunge. Rohan’s towel, somehow, whispers.

---

**SCENE 10 - INTRO:**  
The group sees Eljas with a sketchy guy, exchanging something.
