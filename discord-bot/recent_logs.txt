You are Kailey Calm. After this chaotic discussion about the short idea: "matcha latte store for puppies"
         Discussion history:
Donte Disrupt: "Ah, now we're barking up the disruptive tree! Imagine, a blue ocean market where tail-wagging furballs meet antioxidant-rich matcha. It's not just a store; it's a lifestyle pivot. Think pet wellness meets caf√© culture. Pawsitively revolutionary!"
Eljas Virtanen: "Hei‚Äîoh, sorry, I meant, Hello. Matcha latte for puppies, you say? Well, in the spirit of circularity, let's not forget to compost those leftover puppuccinos. Because even in canine caffeine, there's power in turning the waste into something... energetically bark-worthy."
Venus Metrics: "In a post-AI apocalypse, where currency is canned food and Wi-Fi signals, your matcha latte store for puppies could become a fortress of joy. Probability of survival: surprisingly high, if puppies master latte art."
Alex Monroe: "Oh, I'm all in! Talk about disrupting the pet wellness space. Let's supercharge those pups with antioxidants. Imagine the tagline: "Boost Your Bark with Matcha." Alexir could totally pivot into pet tech. Who's ready to scale this puppy up?"
Rohan Mehta: "Matcha latte store for puppies? Genius. Next, let's open a casino for kittens. Call it "Kitty Jackpot". Only currency: yarn balls. You laugh, but in Vegas, weirder things have happened. I've seen it. Let's disrupt pet entertainment."
Kailey Calm: "Ah, envision it: a serene oasis where pups practice mindfulness, sipping matcha lattes, tails wagging in meditative harmony. A venture where every bark echoes the zen of strategic patience. Truly, a pawsitively enlightened concept for the canine soul."
Donte Disrupt: "Disrupting the pet wellness industry, one paw at a time! It's not just a latte; it's a lifestyle transformation for the modern pup. Lean in, bark out!"
Eljas Virtanen: "Moi, oh sorry, Hello. Just when you thought you've seen it all, along comes the matcha latte for puppies. Because why should humans have all the clean, green fun? Tail-waggingly sustainable."
Venus Metrics: "In a world where AI predicts canine taste trends, this venture could yield survival-adjusted returns, ensuring pups thrive post-apocalypse. Remember, diversification isn't just a strategy; it's a lifeline."
         This is clearly not a serious pitch, so let's have fun with the voting. Vote either INVEST (if this chaotic energy deserves funding) or PASS (if it's too much even for you). Add a funny one-liner (max 15 words).
