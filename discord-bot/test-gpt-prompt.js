â¸»

FORMAT:
CoachName 9:00 AM  
ultra-short, lowercase Slack message (most <10 words, many <5)

â¸»

CAST (keep distinct voices):
- DonteDisrupt â€“ buzzword prophet. lowercase only. "truth is just vibes that got funding"
- AlexirAlex â€“ wellness-obsessed. emoji abuser. says things like "energy" and "vibes"
- RohanTheShark â€“ ruthless operator. one-word responses. "never" or "garbage"
- VenusStrikes â€“ tries to framework chaos and fails. "metrics" and "systems" person
- KaileyConnector â€“ calendar anxiety personified. scheduling breakdown imminent.
- EljasCouncil â€“ finnish mystic. sauna, compost, and nature metaphors.

â¸»

STRICT STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS:
- 40% of messages MUST be under 6 words
- At least 5 messages MUST be single-word or emoji-only
- MAX 15 words for any message
- include at least 3 typos (real human ones, not fake "teh")
- break thread pattern - people talk over each other
- same timestamp sometimes (two people posting at once)
- some messages get zero responses
- abrupt topic changes (at least 2 that make no sense)
- someone posts, then immediately posts again
- reference google docs, notion docs, or deliverables no one has seen
- someone meta-comments on the chaos
- lowercase everything except names

â¸»

CHARACTER ARCS (disguise these as natural typing):
- Donte turns random comment into new initiative with operation name
- Kailey has calendar/scheduling breakdown
- Rohan threatens to quit/start rival company
- Venus tries to create framework for something absurd
- Alex suggests crystal/energy healing for business problem
- Eljas delivers nature wisdom that makes no sense

â¸»

CONCRETE ARTIFACTS (include at least 2):
- Notion doc or framework with absurd name ("Revenue Healing Framework v0.1")
- Scheduled meeting with ridiculous purpose ("Scream Into The Void. Daily.")
- Playbook or guide referencing the chaos ("Crystal Cashflow Playbook")

â¸»

ENDING:
The conversation MUST end with a powerful mic-drop line from one of the coaches. Examples:
- "chaos is just compost with ambition" 
- "new meeting: scream into the void. daily."
- "i've started a doc called burn.it.down"

â¸»

THINK REAL SLACK: messy, people talking over each other, inside jokes, no perfect replies, chaos.

const userPrompt = `continue with 25-30 chaotic short messages.

MUST FOLLOW:
- 40% of messages MUST be under 6 words
- include at least 5 single-word or emoji-only responses
- MAX 15 words per message
- keep it MESSY and RAW - this is real human slack
- include real typos, lowercase, people interrupting
- break thread pattern - reactions come late or don't come
- conversations overlap and derail
- include at least 2 abrupt topic shifts
- meta-commentary on the chaos
- disguise character moments as natural typing
- some messages at same timestamp (people posting simultaneously)
- reference tangible deliverables (notion docs, playbooks, frameworks)

CRITICAL:
- end with a POWERFUL mic-drop line (not something soft)
- include at least 2 fake deliverables or concrete artifacts

remember: authentic slack is MESSY - not clever or polished
