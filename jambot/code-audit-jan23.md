# Jambot Code Audit — January 23, 2025

## Verdict: YES — You Have A Working DAW-Like System

The architecture is **real and implemented**, not just documented aspirations. Here's the breakdown:

## What Actually Works

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **JB01** (drums) | ✅ Fully integrated | Extends `InstrumentNode`, uses `ParamSystem`, has `renderPattern()` AND `renderVoices()` for per-voice effects |
| **JB200** (bass) | ✅ Fully integrated | Extends `InstrumentNode`, uses `ParamSystem`, has `renderPattern()` |
| **Delay effect** | ✅ Working DSP | `effects/delay.js` has real analog + ping pong algorithms, processed in `render.js` |
| **ParamSystem** | ✅ Used by instruments | `session.get()`/`session.set()` unified access, nodes register properly |
| **Effect chains** | ✅ Implemented | `session.mixer.effectChains` with `add_effect` tool, processed in render loop |
| **Per-voice routing** | ✅ Implemented | `jb01.ch`, `jb01.kick` etc. supported via `renderVoices()` in JB01Node |

## Signal Flow (Actually Wired Up)

```
jb01.ch ──[voice effects]──┐
jb01.kick ─────────────────┼──[instrument effects]──┐
jb01.snare ────────────────┘                        │
                                                    ├──[master effects]── output
jb200 ──[instrument effects]────────────────────────┘
```

**Proof it works** — `render.js:194-247` shows `renderInstrumentWithEffects()`:
1. Checks for voice-level effect chains (`getVoiceEffectChains`)
2. If present AND instrument supports `renderVoices()`, renders each voice separately
3. Applies per-voice effect chains
4. Mixes voices, applies instrument-level effects
5. Master effects applied at `render.js:392-414`

## The Routing Example from PLATFORM.md Works

```javascript
add_effect({ target: 'jb01.ch', effect: 'delay', mode: 'pingpong', feedback: 50, mix: 30 })
add_effect({ target: 'jb01', effect: 'delay', mode: 'analog', time: 250 })
```

This stores to `session.mixer.effectChains['jb01.ch']`, which `render.js` finds and processes via `getVoiceEffectChains()`.

## What's NOT Yet Wired

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **RoutingManager** | Exists, not used | `routing.js` has full implementation but render.js doesn't use it |
| **Send buses** | Data only | `route_to_send` stores config but render.js uses effect chains, not sends |
| **Sampler** | Registered | Has node but no `renderPattern()` visible in this review |
| **R9D9/R3D3/R1D1** | Old engines | Registered but marked as "not yet modernized" |

## Pluggability

**Adding a new synth:**
1. Create `instruments/foo-node.js` extending `InstrumentNode`
2. Implement `getParam()`, `setParam()`, `renderPattern()`
3. Register in `session.js`
4. Generic tools (`tweak`, `list_params`, `add_effect`) just work

**Adding a new effect:**
1. Create processing function in `effects/`
2. Add case in `render.js:applyEffect()`
3. Done — routing tools already support it

## Summary

You have **a working pluggable DAW system** with:
- ✅ Two proper synths using the unified architecture
- ✅ Delay effect with real DSP
- ✅ Flexible routing including per-voice effects for JB01
- ✅ Standardized parameter system that generic tools use
- ✅ Pattern that new instruments/effects can follow

The old 909/303/101 engines are placeholders that don't use the new system yet, but the new JB01/JB200 are the real deal.
