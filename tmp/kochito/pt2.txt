This is a great question, and you’re thinking about it exactly the right way: this is not an art problem, it’s a systems + layering problem.

Here’s a clear, non-artist, code-agent-friendly path from VISION (left) → FIRST BUILD (right) using SVG + web animation.

⸻

How to Go from VISION → BUILD (in a few concrete steps)

Mental model (important first)

You are not recreating the left image.

You are:
	•	Using the left image as a background plate
	•	Placing Kochi (SVG) on top
	•	Using layout + masking + subtle motion to sell the illusion

The “art” lives in the background image.
The believability comes from composition and animation.

⸻

Step 1: Treat the background as a static stage

Give the code agent this instruction:

The Tokyo coffee alley image is a single optimized background image.
We do NOT modify it, relight it, or animate it heavily.

Implementation:
	•	Full-bleed div with background-image
	•	background-size: cover
	•	Slight dark vignette or gradient overlay (optional)

This immediately gets you 70% of the “vision”.

⸻

Step 2: Define Kochi as a floating UI layer

Kochi is an inline SVG, positioned absolutely on top of the background.

Key points:
	•	Kochi is not inside the image
	•	Kochi does not inherit lighting
	•	Kochi is always crisp and vector-sharp

Implementation:
	•	Inline SVG in DOM
	•	Absolute positioning relative to viewport
	•	Centered horizontally
	•	Vertically aligned to the bar counter line in the image

The trick: you eyeball the Y-position once and lock it.

⸻

Step 3: Fake the “behind the counter” effect (this is critical)

This is where the right-side build catches up to the left vision.

You do one of these (both are simple):

Option A (easiest): Foreground mask
	•	Export a small foreground strip from the image (the bar front edge)
	•	Place it as a PNG layer above Kochi
	•	Kochi appears partially hidden

Option B (even simpler): Hard crop
	•	Place Kochi lower than the bar top
	•	Let the background image visually occlude the bottom
	•	No actual masking needed

This solves the “no limbs” problem cleanly.

⸻

Step 4: Make Kochi feel alive with minimal motion

This is where GSAP / Web Animations shine.

Give the agent this exact motion spec:

Idle float
	•	Translate Y: ±3–5px
	•	Duration: 6–8s
	•	Easing: sine.inOut
	•	Loop: infinite

Glow breathing
	•	Animate opacity or blur of a glow layer
	•	Duration: 8–12s
	•	Very subtle

Optional blink
	•	Eye scale Y → 0 → 1
	•	Once every ~8 seconds
	•	150–250ms

That’s it.
No bouncing. No waving. No personality acting.

⸻

Step 5: Sell lighting without matching lighting

You do not try to match lantern light direction.

Instead:
	•	Kochi is self-lit
	•	Add:
	•	Soft inner glow
	•	Faint outer halo
	•	Optional slow “light sweep” gradient across SVG

This is how Apple, Stripe, and high-end sites fake realism with flat assets.

⸻

Step 6: Add depth with parallax (cheap, effective)

Split the scene into 3 layers:
	1.	Background image (very slow parallax, or none)
	2.	Kochi SVG (independent motion)
	3.	Foreground elements (optional subtle parallax)

Even 2–4px movement difference sells depth.

⸻

Step 7: Keep text floating, not boxed

From your build screenshot (right), you’re already close.

Rules:
	•	Logo text on top
	•	One line of copy
	•	One CTA
	•	No background cards unless contrast forces it

The page should feel like:

“I arrived somewhere calm.”

⸻

Why this works (important reassurance)

The left image feels rich because:
	•	Composition is strong
	•	Lighting is atmospheric
	•	Kochi is calm and centered

You are reproducing composition + motion, not art technique.

SVG + GSAP is actually an advantage:
	•	Crisp
	•	Lightweight
	•	Intentional
	•	Modern

⸻

TL;DR for the code agent

You can literally paste this:

Use the image as a static stage.
Place Kochi as a self-lit SVG UI element above it.
Partially occlude Kochi using positioning or a simple foreground mask.
Animate Kochi with a slow float and subtle glow.
Do not attempt realistic lighting.
Let composition and motion do the work.

That’s the bridge from vision → build.

If you want, next I can:
	•	Write a one-page implementation checklist
	•	Provide a GSAP timeline snippet
	•	Or help you decide whether to use GSAP vs Web Animations API here

But you’re already on the right track.
