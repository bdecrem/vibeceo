Here’s a clean, hand-off–ready spec you can give directly to a code agent. It’s written to be actionable, opinionated, and constraint-driven — not fluffy.

Kochi.to Landing Page — Implementation Spec

Goal

Build a sparse, mood-driven landing page that loads fast, feels premium, and uses Kochi (SVG) as a calm, animated presence inside a rotating set of background scenes (starting with Tokyo coffee alley).

This is not a traditional SaaS homepage.
It’s a cover page with atmosphere.

⸻

Core Principles (non-negotiable)
	1.	Kochi is a UI element, not a character
	•	Self-lit
	•	Independent of background lighting
	•	No realistic shadows or scene-matching illumination
	2.	Environment tells the story
	•	One full-bleed scene per page
	•	Minimal text layered on top
	•	No feature lists, no scroll narrative
	3.	Motion is ambient, not interactive
	•	Subtle, slow, looped
	•	No scroll hijacking
	•	No gimmicks

⸻

Page Structure (Single Viewport)

Layers (back → front)
	1.	Background Scene
	•	Full-bleed image (e.g. Tokyo coffee alley)
	•	Optimized (WebP / AVIF)
	•	Optional very slow parallax (5–10px max)
	•	Scene can rotate over time (daily/weekly/seasonal)
	2.	Kochi (SVG)
	•	Inline SVG (not img tag)
	•	Positioned relative to scene “container” (e.g. behind bar counter)
	•	Always visible on load
	•	Self-lit via SVG filters
	3.	Text + CTA Overlay
	•	Minimal
	•	Center-weighted
	•	No boxes unless contrast requires it

⸻

Kochi SVG Requirements

Rendering
	•	Inline SVG in DOM
	•	No canvas
	•	No WebGL

Lighting
	•	Self-illumination only
	•	Inner glow (soft)
	•	Outer halo (very subtle)
	•	Do not attempt to match scene lighting

Motion (GSAP or Web Animations API)
	•	Idle float:
	•	Y-axis ±3–5px
	•	Period ~6–8s
	•	Ease: sine.inOut
	•	Glow “breathing”:
	•	Opacity / blur radius
	•	Period ~8–12s
	•	Optional blink:
	•	Infrequent (every ~6–10s)
	•	150–250ms duration

No rotation, no bouncing, no reactions to scroll.

⸻

Containers (How Kochi is Framed)

Kochi must always be partially occluded by a container to justify no limbs.

Allowed containers (v1):
	•	Bar counter (Tokyo scene)
	•	Window / porthole
	•	Glass dome / orb

Implementation:
	•	Container is part of background image OR
	•	Simple foreground mask layer above Kochi

Kochi should never float freely in open space.

⸻

Text Content (Hard Limits)

Required elements only
	1.	Logo / Wordmark
	•	Kochi.to
	•	Top center or slightly above center
	2.	One-line description
	•	Example:
AI delivered daily.
or
AI blasts, delivered daily.
	3.	Single CTA
	•	Label: Try it →
	•	Primary action only

No:
	•	Paragraphs
	•	Bullets
	•	Secondary CTAs
	•	Footer content (can exist but visually minimized)

⸻

CTA Behavior
	•	Hover: slight glow / scale (1.02–1.04)
	•	Click: direct action (SMS / WhatsApp / app flow)
	•	No modal explanation layers on landing

⸻

Performance Requirements
	•	Fast first paint
	•	Background image lazy-loaded but preloaded for hero
	•	Kochi SVG loads immediately
	•	Target:
	•	LCP < 2s
	•	No layout shift
	•	Avoid heavy JS bundles
	•	GSAP optional; Web Animations API acceptable

⸻

Responsiveness

Desktop
	•	Kochi anchored to scene context (e.g. bar counter)
	•	Text floats above, not overlapping Kochi’s face

Mobile
	•	Kochi slightly lower in frame
	•	Text stays readable
	•	CTA reachable without scrolling

No separate “mobile design” — same layout adapts.

⸻

Scene Rotation (Optional but Designed For)
	•	Background scene can be swapped without changing layout or logic
	•	Kochi behavior stays identical across scenes
	•	Only background + color palette change

Scenes are editorial, not functional.

⸻

What NOT to Build
	•	❌ Feature sections
	•	❌ Scroll storytelling
	•	❌ Complex interactions
	•	❌ Realistic lighting simulation
	•	❌ Over-animation

If it feels like a demo, it’s wrong.

⸻

Success Criteria

The page should feel like:
	•	A place you arrive at
	•	Calm, confident, modern
	•	Something that waits for you

User reaction should be:

“Huh. That’s nice.
Okay — I’ll try it.”

⸻

If you want, I can also provide:
	•	A GSAP timeline skeleton
	•	A CSS + SVG filter recipe for Kochi glow
	•	Or a scene rotation config format

But this spec alone is enough to build it correctly.
