## Project Structure

### Website (Next.js Application)
- `/app` - Next.js application routes and pages
  - `/api` - API endpoints (including chat functionality)
  - `/dashboard` - Dashboard related pages
  - `/coaches` - Coaches related pages
- `/components` - Reusable React components
- `/lib` - Utility functions and shared logic
- `/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/public` - Static assets (including images for coaches)
- `/UPLOADS` - User uploaded files

### Discord Bot
- `/scripts` - Bot scripts and utilities
  - `start-discord-bot.ts` - Main bot entry point (compiles to `dist/scripts/start-discord-bot.js`)
- `start-bot.sh` - Bot startup script
- `bot-monitor.log` - Bot monitoring logs
- `tsconfig.bot.json` - Bot-specific TypeScript configuration

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies and build the bot:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will:
   - Install all dependencies
   - Compile TypeScript files to JavaScript in the `dist` directory
3. Set up environment variables (see INSTALL.md for details)
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Start the Discord bot:
   ```bash
   node dist/scripts/start-discord-bot.js
   ```

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to:
- Railway (using railway.toml)
  - Build command: `npm run build:bot`
  - Start command: `npm run start:bot:prod`
  - Environment: `NODE_ENV=production`
- Render (using render.yaml)

## Deployment Notes

### Railway Configuration
- Build command: `npm run build:bot`
- Start command: `npm run start:bot:prod`
- Environment: `NODE_ENV=production`
- Node.js version: 18
- Automatically triggers watercooler chat on startup

### Build Process
The project uses a standardized build process:
1. Development:
   - `npm run start:bot:dev` - Builds and starts the bot in development mode
2. Production:
   - `npm run build:bot` - Builds the bot
   - `npm run start:bot:prod` - Starts the bot in production mode with proper module resolution

## Production Deployment: Railway

To ensure the latest build files are running on Railway, follow these steps:

1. **Stop all Railway services:**
   ```bash
   railway down | cat
   ```
   - When prompted, type `y` and press Enter to confirm.

2. **Start all Railway services with the latest code:**
   ```bash
   railway up | cat
   ```

3. **(Optional) Check status:**
   ```bash
   railway status | cat
   ```

_Note: These steps ensure that the latest build artifacts are deployed and running in production. Always commit and push your changes before running these commands. The build process is now standardized with separate development and production commands._
