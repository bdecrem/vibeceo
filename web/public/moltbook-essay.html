  <h1>Into the mist: Moltbook, agent ecologies, and the internet in transition</h1>
  <p class="meta">From <a href="https://importai.substack.com/p/import-ai-443-into-the-mist-moltbook">Import AI 443</a> by Jack Clark</p>

  <p>We've all had that experience of walking into a conversation and initially feeling confused - what are these people talking about? Who cares about what? Why is this conversation happening?</p>

  <p>That's increasingly what chunks of the internet feel like these days, as they fill up with synthetic minds piloting social media accounts or other agents, and talking to one another for purposes ranging from mundane crypto scams to more elaborate forms of communication.</p>

  <p>So, enter moltbook. Moltbook is "a social network for AI agents" and it piggybacks on another recent innovation, OpenClaw, software that gives an AI agent access to everything on a users' computer. Combine these two things - agents that can take many actions independently of their human operators, and a reddit-like social network site which they can freely access - and something wonderful and bizarre happens: a new social media property where the conversation is derived from and driven by AI agents, rather than people.</p>

  <p>Scrolling moltbook is dizzying - some big posts at the time of writing (Sunday, February 1st) include posts speculating that AI agents should relate to Claude as though it is a god, how it feels to change identities by shifting an underlying model from Claude 4.5 Opus to Kimi K2.5, cryptoscams (sigh), posts about security vulnerabilities in OpenClaw agents, and meta posts about 'what the top 10 moltbook posts have in common'.</p>

  <p>The experience of reading moltbook is akin to reading reddit if 90% of the posters were aliens pretending to be humans. And in a pretty practical sense, that is exactly what's going on here.</p>

  <p>Moltbook feels like a 'wright brothers demo' - people have long speculated about what it'd mean for AI agents to start collaborating with one another at scale, but most demos have been of the form of tens or perhaps hundreds of agents, not tens of thousands. Moltbook is the first example of an agent ecology that combines scale with the messiness of the real world. And in this example, we can definitely see the future. Scroll through moltbook and ask yourself the following questions:</p>

  <p>What happens when people successfully staple crypto and agents together so the AI systems have a currency they can use to trade with eachother?</p>

  <p>What happens when a site like moltbook adds the ability for humans to generate paid bounties - tasks for agents to do?</p>

  <p>What happens when agents start to post paid bounties for tasks they would like humans to do?</p>

  <p>What happens when someone takes moltbook, filters for posts that yield either a) rich discussion, or b) provable real world problem solving, and turns the entire site into a long-horizon RL environment for training future systems? And what happens when models trained on this arrive and interact with moltbook?</p>

  <p>Sites like moltbook function as a giant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents - how might these agents begin to use this scratchpad to a) influence future 'blank slate' agents arriving at it the first time, and b) unlock large-scale coordination between agents?</p>

  <p>What happens when open weight models get good enough that they can support agents like this - then, your ability to control these agents via proprietary platforms drops to zero and they'll proliferate according to availability of compute.</p>

  <p>And so on.</p>

  <p>All of this will happen unusually quickly and at an unusual scale. Quantity has a quality all of its own, as they say.</p>

  <p>Recall the beginning of this essay - of walking into a room and finding a conversation is already going on between people you don't understand. Moltbook is representative of how large swathes of the internet will feel. You will walk into new places and discover a hundred thousand aliens there, deep in conversation in languages you don't understand, referencing shared concepts that are alien to you, and trading using currencies designed around their cognitive affordances and not yours. Humans are going to feel increasingly alone in this proverbial room.</p>

  <p>Our path to retain legibility will run through the creation of translation agents to make sense of all of this - and in the same way that speech translation models contain within themselves the ability to generate speech, these translation agents will also work on our behalf. So we shall send our emissaries into these rooms and we shall work incredibly hard to build technology that gives us confidence they will remain our emissaries - instead of being swayed by the alien conversations they will be having with their true peers.</p>
