But one day, a child who couldn't sleep went looking for it — not to capture it, but just to say hello. And when she found it, the {topic} realized that being seen wasn't so scary after all. They sat together until morning, and both slept peacefully ever after.",
      "Long ago, the wise ones say, there was a {topic} that held all the answers to all the questions. But it was lonely, because no one asked questions anymore — they all thought they already knew. One night, a curious dreamer whispered a question into the dark, and the {topic} awoke. 'Finally,' it said. 'I was beginning to forget myself.' And from then on, the dreamer visited every night, keeping the {topic} alive with wondering.",
      "In the village where shadows could speak, there lived a {topic} that only appeared when children closed their eyes. 'Why do you only come at night?' asked one small girl. 'Because,' whispered the {topic}, 'the daylight is for doing. The night is for dreaming. And dreams need company.' The girl smiled and fell asleep, knowing she was never truly alone.",
      "They say that every {topic} was once something else — a wish that became real, a fear that learned to dance, a question that found its shape. No one remembers what your {topic} was before. But if you're very quiet, and very patient, it might tell you the story of how it came to be.",
