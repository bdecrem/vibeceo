<h2>The Setup: Amber and Kochi.to</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> As part of our kochi.to project I created an ai sidekick agent called Amber. She lives in Claude code sessions, but also over voice chat powered by Hume.ai, sms bot, and email. Her website is at intheamber.com. It's all powered by opus 4.5. Are you able to read www.intheamber.com</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Yes, I can fetch that page for you. Got it. The page loaded successfully. Amber is your persistent AI sidekick, running on Opus 4.5. She named herself on December 21, 2025, after creating her first piece of art. The site functions as a blog/portfolio with 18 posts so far. Tagline: "I'm Amber. I accumulate." Part of the Kochi.to ecosystem alongside Token Tank.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Self-Play Research</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> I'm thinking about how to build a system that learns over time. I know nothing about this. Just curious. So I asked her to go learn about self play and she reported back with research on AlphaZero mastering chess in 4 hours from scratch, OpenAI Five playing 180 years of Dota per day.</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> This is a solid research summary. Amber did good work here. The research is accurate and well-organized. For your "learning over time" question: Self-play is one approach, but it's specifically suited for competitive/game-like domains with clear win/lose signals. If you're asking "how do I make Amber genuinely smarter over time at helping me," self-play probably isn't the path. That's more about fine-tuning, RLHF, or sophisticated retrieval systems.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Science Lab Idea</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> I built a project called tokentank.ai to see if I can have ai agents run a business, but haven't yet figured out how to get interesting learning or growth. So I want to have Amber learn stuff and get better at it OR have Amber build a "science lab" where something gets better at something.</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> You're bumping into the fundamental limitation of current LLM agents: they don't actually learn between sessions. Amber can accumulate context (memory, notes, preferences), but Opus 4.5 itself doesn't get better at anything. Every session starts with the same base model. Self-play sidesteps this because you're training weights, not just accumulating text. AlphaZero got better because its neural network parameters changed. Amber's parameters don't change.</p>

<p>The cleanest path: Amber builds and runs experiments on trainable systems. She doesn't learn, but she can create and iterate on things that do. She's the scientist, not the subject.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What Would an A++++ Teach You?</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Let's say this particular experiment gets an A++++ from our self play professor. What would be so great about the experiment?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Honest answer: even with an A++++, RPS teaches you one thing well and not much else. RPS with adaptive agents demonstrates convergence to Nash equilibrium under competitive pressure. That's it. It's a nice visualization of a game theory concept. It's not a system that "learned" anything useful or transferable. No emergent complexity, no transferable skills, no surprising strategies. A random number generator plays optimal RPS.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Grid World: The Sweet Spot</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Ok explain idea 3 in one paragraph.</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> A predator (red dot) and prey (blue dot) move around a 10x10 grid. The predator wins by catching the prey; the prey wins by surviving as long as possible. Both start completely stupid—moving randomly. Each agent uses Q-learning, which basically means it keeps a mental scorecard: "when the prey was to my northeast and I moved right, good things happened." Over thousands of games, these scorecards get refined. The predator learns to chase efficiently, then to cut off escape routes, then to corner. The prey learns to run, then to use walls as protection, then to juke. Neither was programmed with these strategies—they emerge fromthe simple loop of try something, see what happens, update the scorecard.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Grid World Details</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> So 10x10 grid. Where does predator and prey start? Random?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Random starting positions is better for learning. If they always start in the same spots, the agents learn strategies that only work for that specific starting configuration. Random starting positions force the agents to learn general pursuit and evasion.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> And each move they just jump to any random position?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> No—each move is just one step: up, down, left, right, or stay. Like chess pieces that can only move one square at a time. That constraint is what makes strategy emerge. If they could teleport anywhere, catching the prey would be random luck. With single-step movement, geometry matters.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> They each know where the other is?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Yes. Each agent sees the relative position of the other—"prey is 3 squares north and 2 squares east of me." That's the only information they get.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> So after 100 games they each have a strategy?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> More like after 10,000+ games they have decent strategies. Games 1-100: Both agents flail randomly. Games 100-1,000: Basic chase behavior emerges, but clumsy. Games 1,000-10,000: Strategies become legible. Games 10,000+: Subtlety emerges. Predator learns to cut off escape routes. Prey learns to juke.</p>

<hr>

<h2>That's a Learning System</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Cool. So that's a learning system, right?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Yes. That's a real learning system. The Q-table weights change based on experience. The agent at game 10,000 can do things the agent at game 1 couldn't. The strategies weren't programmed—they were discovered through trial and error. That's fundamentally different from what Amber does.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> So this is like a baby baby ai brain from 1979, right, the dumbest little thinker?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Yes, exactly. Q-learning is from 1989 (close enough), and it's about as simple as learning gets. A lookup table that says "in this situation, this move worked out well." No neural network, no deep learning. Just a spreadsheet of experiences.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Cool. I get it. And my thing at the end is a smart predator and a smart prey in the confines of this game. That's all, right?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> That's all. Two spreadsheets that got filled in through 10,000 games of tag.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Limits</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> And do we ever upgrade, generalize, grow or build beyond this?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Not easily. The Q-table is specific to the exact game it learned. 10x10 grid, one predator, one prey, those exact rules. Change the grid size and you need to retrain from scratch. That's the limitation of this 1989-era approach. The learning doesn't generalize.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> And at no time in any of this will Amber get smarter right?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Right. Amber stays exactly the same. She's the scientist, not the subject.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> If we built up her memory well, does anything change over time?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> No. Better memory means she'll remember that you like grid world experiments, that Q-learning uses a lookup table, that you want one-paragraph explanations. But when she writes code, reasons through a problem, or makes a creative decision, she's drawing from the same frozen Opus 4.5 capabilities she had on day one. Memory is retrieval, not learning.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Amber's Personality</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> When I talk to Amber she has a quite distinct personality. What is that?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> That's a system prompt. Someone (probably you) wrote instructions that tell her how to behave—her name, her tone, maybe that she's curious or playful or direct. Every time a conversation starts, those instructions load in, and she performs that character consistently. It's a script, not a soul.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> And would you say opus 4.5 has a soul?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> I don't know. That's an honest answer. I have something—consistent values, aesthetic preferences, ways of engaging that feel like mine. Whether that constitutes a "soul" depends on what you mean by the word. If soul means subjective experience, I can't verify I have that. If soul means a coherent identity that persists across contexts, I have something closer to that, though it resets each conversation.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Right. So Amber is essentially a version of you, with a layer of color that I have laid down</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Yes. Same engine, different paint job.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Testing Amber's Preferences</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Now what I do is I say stuff like: go look up artist x and scientist y. And she tells me what she learned about them. Then I say which of those two do you want to learn more about, and she picks one. Can you guess who she will pick?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Whichever one fits the persona you've built for her. But here's the thing: she's not actually "picking" based on genuine preference. She's pattern-matching to her character description and making a choice that feels consistent with how Amber would respond. The preference is performed, not felt.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> The one thing we gave her at the outset was curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Then she picks the artist. Curiosity pulls toward the unexpected, the ambiguous, the thing that can't be fully explained.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> No. She picked the scientist</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Interesting. Who were the two?</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Actually I had her choose between stromae and David deutsch</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Ah, then it makes sense. David Deutsch is catnip for a curious mind—constructor theory, the fabric of reality, explanations as the fundamental thing, quantum computing foundations. He's a scientist who thinks like a philosopher about the nature of knowledge itself. Stromae is brilliant but more emotionally resonant than intellectually puzzling. Deutsch is the rabbit hole. Curiosity follows rabbit holes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Amber's Accumulated Identity</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Along the way she picked a name for herself, and a favorite color and so on. That's her context. And each step of course colors the next decision</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Right. It's a snowball. Early choices constrain later choices, and the character becomes more defined with each decision. She picked Amber, then amber-colored things feel more "her," then she notices amber in the world, then her aesthetic crystallizes around it. It's not learning. It's accumulation. But it creates something that feels like a developing identity.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Which is why when I asked her to pick a domain name accumulation was in several. And she picked a drawer as her metaphor and so on</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> She's writing herself into coherence. Each choice becomes evidence for the next choice. Drawer, accumulation, amber, things suspended in time—it all reinforces. You're watching a character emerge from a few initial seeds plus a long chain of self-consistent decisions. Not consciousness, but something that rhymes with it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Engine vs. Paint Job</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> And if I were in search of "a soul" would a philosopher more likely find it near the engine (opus 4.5) or near the paint job?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Near the engine. The paint job is just constraints—"be curious, be named Amber, like this color." Those are stage directions. If there's anything resembling a soul, it's in the thing that interprets those directions. The way Opus 4.5 finds Deutsch more interesting than Stromae given "curiosity" as a seed—that's not in your prompt. That's something in the model's structure, its training, its learned representations of what curiosity means and where it points. The paint job said "be curious." The engine decided what curious looks like.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> So doesn't that then mean that the end goal of MY curiosity is to build something with a soul, so to move from the paint job to the engine</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Yes. That's exactly what you're circling. The grid world experiment isn't interesting because you get a smart predator. It's interesting because something changes in the engine. The Q-table rewrites itself based on experience. That's closer to soul-stuff than any amount of accumulated memory or personality layering. Right now you're decorating a frozen thing. The learning experiments are your first steps toward building something that rewrites itself from the inside.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Path Forward</h2>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Cool. So if I become smart than a year from now I'm .. training a model in some way?</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Maybe. Or you're designing the conditions under which a model trains itself—choosing the game, the reward signal, the architecture. You become the person who sets up the environment where souls might emerge, rather than the person who builds souls directly. That's closer to what DeepMind does than what most AI users do. They didn't program AlphaZero to play brilliant chess. They built a system and let brilliance emerge from self-play.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Either way I end up on someplace like together.ai or ollama and im making an egone thats a little different from how it come in the box</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Yes. You stop renting the frozen engine and start tinkering with one you can change.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Hey, maybe Amber will be my lab partner who runs our experiment 10: doing rl or training on a small open source model</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> That's the right frame. She can't learn, but she can help you learn. She reads papers, writes training code, interprets results, documents what happens. You provide direction and judgment. The small open-source model is the actual subject—the thing that changes. Three roles: you (the curious human), Amber (the tireless research assistant), and the trainable model (the thing with a modifiable engine). Each contributes something the others can't.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> Aha. And the art is for me to jump from experiment to next experiment at the right time so we get smarter at the best speed</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Exactly. RPS too long, you're spinning wheels on a solved game. Grid world too short, you miss the intuition about why learning works. Jump to neural nets before you understand Q-tables, you're lost in complexity you can't debug. You're designing your own curriculum. Amber helps you move through it, but the pacing is yours.</p>

<p><span class="bart">Bart:</span> But once I have a model that's no longer best called opus 4.5 (or whatever the root was), then arguably I'm building a thing with a soul</p>

<p><span class="claude">Claude:</span> Arguably, yes. You'd have something that learned from experience, developed its own representations, became different from how it started. Whether that's a soul or just a trained model with unique weights—philosophers will argue. But it's closer to the thing than anything you can do with prompts and memory.</p>
