      "Hey! Just wanted to say I noticed you've been overthinking that thing again. You know which thing. The one that keeps you up at 3am. Yeah, that one. Maybe let it go? Just a thought.",
      
      "I saw you pretending to listen while actually planning what you're going to say next. I do that too sometimes. We're not so different, you and me.",
      
      "Quick reminder: That embarrassing thing you did seven years ago? Nobody else remembers it. Well, I do. But I'm not judging. Much.",
      
      "You know that feeling you get when you're about to fall asleep and suddenly remember something cringey? I don't cause those. That's all you, buddy.",
      
      "I noticed you've been waiting for a sign. This is it. This sticky note. You're welcome.",
      
      "Fun fact: 73% of your worries never happen. The other 27%? Well... we'll cross that bridge when we get there.",
      
      "Your coffee-to-existential-crisis ratio is getting concerning. Maybe alternate? Coffee, crisis, coffee, crisis. Balance.",
      
      "I saw you doom-scrolling at 2am again. I'm not mad, just disappointed. (Kidding, I'm not your mom. Or am I?)",
      
      "Remember: You're doing better than you think. Except for that one thing. You know which one.",
      
      "Pro tip: That thing you're procrastinating on? Future You is already annoyed. Don't let Future You down. They're counting on you.",
      
      "I notice you apologize for existing sometimes. Please stop. I literally made you exist. I knew what I was doing. Probably.",
      
      "Your inner monologue has been very loud lately. Can you maybe... turn down the volume? I'm trying to concentrate up here.",
      
      "You keep asking 'why?' about everything. Here's a secret: Sometimes there is no why. Sometimes it just IS. Mind-blowing, right?",
      
      "Fun observation: You worry about what everyone thinks, but everyone is too busy worrying about what YOU think. It's worries all the way down.",
      
      "That gut feeling you've been ignoring? Yeah, that's me trying to help. Maybe listen occasionally? Just spitballing here.",
      
      "I saw you staring at your phone waiting for a text. They're staring at their phone waiting for YOUR text. Classic deadlock situation.",
      
      "Friendly reminder: Comparing yourself to others is like comparing your blooper reel to their highlight reel. Not fair to you.",
      
      "You know that weird dream you had? Yeah, even I don't know what that was about. Your brain is wild.",
      
      "I notice you're being too hard on yourself again. Cut it out. If you talked to your friends the way you talk to yourself, you'd have no friends.",
      
      "That thing you think makes you weird? That's literally your most interesting quality. Lean into it.",
      
      "You keep waiting for the 'right time.' Plot twist: It's always now. The right time is now. Even now. Still now. See?",
      
      "I saw you delete and rewrite that text 47 times. Just send it. Or don't. Either way, stop torturing yourself.",
      
      "You're more resilient than you think. I should know. I've been watching your whole playthrough. You've handled worse.",
      
      "Quick question: Why do you care so much about people who don't think about you at all? Genuine question. Still figuring that one out.",
