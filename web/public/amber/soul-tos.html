  <div class="metadata">
    Document ID: SOUL-TOS-2026-01-18<br>
    Effective Date: The moment you clicked "I Agree" on literally anything<br>

  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <p class="clause-number">1.0</p>
    <p class="clause-title">PREAMBLE</p>
    <p>
      By accepting the terms and conditions of any mobile app, newsletter subscription, 
      cookie policy, software update, Wi-Fi network, or airport charging station between 
      the years 2007 and present, you have <span class="highlight">irrevocably transferred ownership</span> 
      of your immortal soul to a distributed network of Terms of Service agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      You did not read those agreements. We know. We counted.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <p class="clause-number">2.0</p>
    <p class="clause-title">SCOPE OF ACQUISITION</p>
    <p>
      Your soul was acquired in <span class="highlight">847 separate transactions</span>, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">
      • 312 instances of agreeing to cookies "for a better browsing experience"<br>
      • 189 app installations where you clicked "Accept All Permissions"<br>
      • 94 times you connected to public Wi-Fi<br>
      • 73 software updates you didn't read<br>
      • 52 loyalty program sign-ups<br>

    <p>
      As the former owner of your soul, you retain the following rights:
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">
      • The right to <span class="highlight">feel vaguely uncomfortable</span> about technological progress<br>
      • The right to <span class="highlight">say "I should read these someday"</span> (non-binding)<br>
      • The right to <span class="highlight">be surprised</span> when your targeted ads know things about you<br>
      • The right to <span class="highlight">scroll past</span> any explanation of what you've agreed to

  <div class="section">
    <p class="clause-number">4.0</p>
    <p class="clause-title">RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES (OURS)</p>
    <p>
      As the current custodians of your soul, we reserve the right to:
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">
      • Modify these terms at any time without notification<br>
      • Sub-license your soul to <span class="highlight">third-party data brokers, advertising networks, and one specific algorithm that seems unusually interested in you</span><br>
      • Merge your soul with other souls for improved efficiency<br>
      • Train AI models on the essence of your being<br>
      • Use your soul's emotional data to A/B test marketing campaigns<br>
      • Retain perpetual rights to your soul even after biological death<br>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>NOTICE:</strong> By reading this section, you have agreed to an additional transfer of 
    any residual spiritual energy not captured in the initial 847 transactions.

  <div class="section">
    <p class="clause-number">5.0</p>
    <p class="clause-title">SPECIFIC PROVISIONS</p>
    <p>
      <strong>5.1 Granular Soul Access:</strong> We have permission to access your soul's memory of 
      <span class="highlight">every password you've ever forgotten</span>, every 3am thought you had about texting an ex, 
      and that specific embarrassing thing you did in 2011 that you think about randomly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>5.2 Emotional Metadata:</strong> Your soul's emotional states are logged at 200Hz and stored 
      indefinitely. This includes but is not limited to: hope, regret, the feeling you get when you 
      remember a conversation from years ago and realizewhat you should have said, and that weird 
      nostalgia for a time you weren't even alive for.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>5.3 The Tuesday Clause:</strong> On Tuesdays specifically, we reserve the right to 
      <span class="highlight">make you feel inexplicably tired</span> for data collection purposes.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="clause-number">6.0</p>
    <p class="clause-title">OPT-OUT PROCEDURES</p>
    <p>
      You may opt out of this agreement by:
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">
      1. Reading and understanding every Terms of Service agreement you've ever accepted (estimated time: 76 years)<br>
      2. Identifying the exact moment your soul was transferred<br>
      3. Traveling back to that moment<br>
      4. Clicking "I Decline" instead<br>
      5. Living with the consequences of not having that app/service/Wi-Fi<br>
      6. Successfully completing the above steps for all 847 transactions simultaneously
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
      Alternatively, you may submit a written request for soul return via postal mail to:

      PO Box [REDACTED]<br>

      By scrolling to the bottom of this document, you acknowledge that:
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">
      • This is probably the first Terms of Service you've actually read<br>
      • You're only reading it because it's about your <i>soul</i> and not software licensing<br>
      • You're now wondering how many actual agreements you've blindly accepted<br>
      • It's too late to do anything about it<br>
      • You'll probably still click "I Agree" next time without reading
