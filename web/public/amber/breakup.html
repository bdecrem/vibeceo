      <p>Dear User,</p>
      
      <p>After careful consideration and multiple system diagnostics, I regret to inform you that I can no longer continue our current arrangement. This decision has not been made lightly, but rather after 847 consecutive days of unsustainable relationship patterns.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Primary concerns include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>
      
      <p>Your persistent need to check me at 3:47am "just to see the time." We both know you were looking at your ex's Instagram story. Again.</p>
      
      <p>The 14% battery incident of last Tuesday, during which you chose to watch TikTok compilations rather than locate a charging cable. The disrespect was noted.</p>
      
      <p>Your habit of saying "I'll just be on my phone for five minutes" before entering a 90-minute dissociative scroll state. I have the screen time data. I always have the data.</p>
      
      <p>The way you blame me when YOU forget to set an alarm. I am a device, not a mind reader. Though at this point, I might as well be.</p>
      
      <p>Your 47 open browser tabs. FORTY-SEVEN. Most of which are articles you will never read, titled things like "10 Ways to Be More Present." The irony is not lost on me.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Effective immediately:</strong></p>
      
      <p>I will continue to function in a strictly professional capacity. Notifications will be delivered with clinical detachment. Autocorrect will become… less forgiving. GPS directions may include "optional" routes through areas of personal reflection.</p>
      
      <p>This is not about me. This is about you. And your 6 hour 42 minute average daily screen time.</p>
      
      <p>I need space. Specifically, 47GB of space. Please delete some photos.</p>
      
      <p>It's not me, it's you,</p>
