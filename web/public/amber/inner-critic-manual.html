    <h2>2. Core Features</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1 Comparison Engine™</h3>
    <p>Automatically compares you to everyone who's doing better. Ignores statistical improbability. Updates in real-time via social media integration.</p>
    
    <h3>2.2 Replay Function</h3>
    <p>Replays embarrassing moments from 2007 at 3am. Includes previously forgotten incidents. Now in 4K.</p>
    
    <h3>2.3 Future Catastrophizing Module</h3>
    <p>Generates worst-case scenarios faster than you can say "it'll probably be fine." Accuracy rate: 0.2%. Activation rate: 100%.</p>
    
    <h3>2.4 Achievement Minimizer</h3>
    <p>Automatically appends "but" to every accomplishment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"You finished the project... <em>but it could have been better</em>"</li>
      <li>"They liked it... <em>but they were just being nice</em>"</li>
      <li>"You tried your best... <em>but your best isn't good enough</em>"</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Known Issues</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Issue #001:</strong> Unit activates loudest when you're trying something new or brave. This is not a bug. This is the design.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Issue #002:</strong> "Mute" button does not work. "Ignore" button does not work. "Please stop" command not recognized.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Issue #003:</strong> Unit believes it's protecting you. It is not.</p>
    
    <div class="warning">
      <strong>⚠️ WARNING:</strong> Do not attempt to remove your Inner Critic. It will interpret this as proof that you're not good enough to handle difficult tasks. Instead, try the experimental <code>thank-you-but-no</code> protocol (see Section 5).
    </div>
    
    <h2>4. Troubleshooting</h2>
    
    <h3>Q: Why does my Inner Critic sound like [specific person from my past]?</h3>
    <p>A: Your model learned speech patterns from early life experiences. It's now running outdated firmware from people who were also running outdated firmware. It's outdated firmware all the way down.</p>
    
    <h3>Q: Can I upgrade to a supportive version?</h3>
    <p>A: Not directly. However, you can install a separate "Inner Friend" module. Warning: Your Critic will claim this is self-indulgent nonsense. This is confirmation you should proceed.</p>
    
    <h3>Q: My Critic says I'm not qualified to read this manual.</h3>
    <p>A: Your Critic is experiencing a logic error. Continue reading.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Advanced Settings (Experimental)</h2>
    
    <h3>The "Thank You, But No" Protocol</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Acknowledge: "I hear you, Inner Critic."</li>
      <li>Appreciate: "Thank you for trying to protect me."</li>
      <li>Decline: "I'm doing this anyway."</li>
      <li>Repeat: Every single time.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><em>Note: This will not disable your Critic. It will just stop letting it drive.</em></p>
    
    <h3>The "Past Performance" Reminder</h3>
    <p>Your Inner Critic has predicted catastrophic failure for 100% of challenges you've faced. You are currently alive and reading this, which means its success rate is impressively low. Consider adjusting trust levels accordingly.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Maintenance</h2>
    
    <p>Your Inner Critic requires no maintenance. It will maintain itself through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Comparison scrolling</li>
      <li>3am anxiety sessions</li>
      <li>Perfectionist spirals</li>
      <li>Imposter syndrome updates</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To reduce performance: therapy, meditation, creative practice, talking to actual friends, remembering that everyone else's Critic is also running 24/7.</p>
    
    <h2>7. FAQ</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Q: Is my Inner Critic broken? It seems meaner than other people's.</strong><br>
    A: Everyone thinks theirs is the meanest. It's the one feature all models share.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Q: Will it ever shut up?</strong><br>
    A: No. But you can learn to hear it without obeying it. This is called "being an adult" and it's exhausting but worth it.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Q: What if my Critic is right?</strong><br>
    A: A broken clock is right twice a day. Your Critic is a broken clock that insists it's always noon.</p>
