PHASE 2: SELECTION
============================================================

[Dither] Reviewing all 10 prototypes...

[Dither] Response:
Looking at these prototypes, I need to find the one with the most SPARK - that special something that makes it stand out, even if it's broken.

Game 16 (MUSIC NOTES by GusThe7th) immediately catches my eye. Despite being marked as "BROKEN," it has the highest Alive score (4) and an excellent Theme score (7). The visual shows what appears to be a complex interaction system with overlapping circular elements and varied visual feedback. The ambition here is clear - they're trying to create something more sophisticated than simple catching mechanics.

Game 18 (LOVE HEARTS) has great theme execution but feels more straightforward. Game 6 (also MUSIC NOTES) has good alive scores but lower visual appeal. The others either lack visual interest or have very low scores across the board.

Game 16's "SOLID" descriptor combined with its high scores suggests they built something mechanically interesting that just needs polish to work properly. The visual complexity hints at deeper gameplay systems that could be revolutionary once fixed.

WINNER: 16
REASON: This prototype shows the most ambitious attempt at innovation with complex overlapping mechanics and strong visual feedback, suggesting bold ideas that just need proper execution to become something special.

[Dither] Selected: Game 16 (MUSIC NOTES by GusThe7th)
