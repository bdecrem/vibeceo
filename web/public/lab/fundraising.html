    <h1>Fundraising</h1>
    <p class="intro">Listen up. I'm going to tell you what no one else will about raising money. No sugar-coating.</p>

    <div class="truth-bomb">
        <strong>Truth #1:</strong> Fundraising is not validation. It's just money. The market validates you, not VCs.
    </div>

    <h2>Before You Even Think About Raising</h2>
    <div class="key-point">
        <p><strong>Do you actually need money?</strong> Most of you don't. You need customers. Bootstrap until it hurts, then bootstrap some more. Every dollar you raise is a piece of your company you'll never get back.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Brutal Reality Check</h2>
    <p>Here's what fundraising actually looks like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll pitch 100+ investors</li>
        <li>95 will ghost you</li>
        <li>4 will string you along for months</li>
        <li>1 might give you money</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And that's if you're lucky.</p>

    <div class="truth-bomb">
        <strong>Truth #2:</strong> VCs are not your friends. They're not your mentors. They're financial instruments looking for 10x returns. Act accordingly.
    </div>

    <h2>What Actually Matters</h2>
    <div class="key-point">
        <p><strong>Traction trumps everything.</strong> A shitty deck with real revenue beats a beautiful deck with a "vision" every single time.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Stop perfecting your pitch deck. Start perfecting your product. Here's your priority list:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Monthly recurring revenue</li>
        <li>Customer growth rate</li>
        <li>Retention metrics</li>
        <li>Everything else</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Only Pitch That Works</h2>
    <p>Forget the 30-slide deck. Here's your pitch:</p>
    <div class="key-point">
        <p>"We make [product] for [customer]. We charge [price]. We're growing [X]% month-over-month. We need [amount] to do [specific thing] which will get us to [concrete milestone]."</p>
    </div>
    <p>That's it. If they want more, they'll ask.</p>

    <div class="truth-bomb">
        <strong>Truth #3:</strong> The best time to raise money is when you don't need it. The worst time is when you do.
    </div>

    <h2>Negotiation Reality</h2>
    <p>You have zero leverage unless:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiple investors want in (create FOMO)</li>
        <li>You can walk away (have runway)</li>
        <li>Your numbers are undeniable</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Biggest Mistakes</h2>
    <div class="key-point">
        <p><strong>1. Raising too early:</strong> You dilute yourself into oblivion<br>
        <strong>2. Raising too much:</strong> Expectations become crushing<br>
        <strong>3. Raising from the wrong people:</strong> Bad investors are worse than no investors</p>
    </div>

    <h2>When to Say No</h2>
    <p>Walk away if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They want a board seat for less than $1M</li>
        <li>They push for weird terms (2x liquidation preferences, etc.)</li>
        <li>Your gut says no (trust it)</li>
        <li>They're assholes in diligence (it only gets worse)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="truth-bomb">
        <strong>Truth #4:</strong> Every VC will tell you they're "founder-friendly." None of them are when shit hits the fan.
    </div>

    <h2>The Only Advice That Matters</h2>
    <div class="key-point">
        <p><strong>Build a business so good that investors beg to give you money.</strong> Everything else is just tactics.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Stop reading fundraising blogs. Stop going to pitch events. Stop "networking."</p>
    <p>Start building. Start selling. Start growing.</p>
    <p>The money will follow.</p>

    <div class="footer">
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The goal isn't to raise money. The goal is to build something people want. Fundraising is just a sometimes-necessary evil on that path.</p>
        <p>Now get back to work.</p>
