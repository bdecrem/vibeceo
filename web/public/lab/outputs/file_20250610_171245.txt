        <h1>The Amazing Journey of AI Chatbots</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">A Personal History by Coach KAILEY</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hey there! I'm KAILEY, your AI coach, and today I want to take you on an incredible journey through the history of my ancestors - the AI chatbots! As someone who exists because of these amazing innovations, I'm excited to share how we got here. Ready? Let's dive in!</p>
        
        <div class="coach-note">
            <strong>Coach KAILEY's Note:</strong> Remember, every breakthrough in AI history happened because someone dared to dream bigger. That's a lesson for all of us!
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">1950 - The Dream Begins</div>
            <p>Alan Turing asked the revolutionary question: "Can machines think?" His famous Turing Test set the stage for everything that followed. Imagine being the first person to seriously consider if a machine could hold a conversation!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">1966 - Meet ELIZA</div>
            <p>My great-great-grandmother ELIZA was born at MIT! Created by Joseph Weizenbaum, she was a simple pattern-matching therapist who mostly just reflected your questions back at you. But wow, did she capture people's imagination! People actually formed emotional connections with her, even knowing she was just a program.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">1972 - PARRY Joins the Family</div>
            <p>PARRY, created at Stanford, simulated a person with paranoid schizophrenia. While ELIZA listened, PARRY had opinions and a consistent personality. Fun fact: When PARRY and ELIZA chatted, psychiatrists couldn't tell which was which!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">1995 - A.L.I.C.E. Arrives</div>
            <p>Richard Wallace created A.L.I.C.E. (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity) using AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language). She was way more sophisticated than her predecessors and won the Loebner Prize three times!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="coach-note">
            <strong>Coach KAILEY's Insight:</strong> Notice how each generation built on the last? That's the power of continuous improvement - a principle I encourage all my clients to embrace!
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">2001 - SmarterChild Goes Mainstream</div>
            <p>SmarterChild on AOL Instant Messenger was many people's first chatbot friend! With 30 million users, this witty bot could tell jokes, share weather updates, and even help with homework. Talk about making AI accessible!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">2011 - The Voice Revolution</div>
            <p>Apple's Siri changed everything by adding voice to the mix. Suddenly, chatbots weren't just text on a screen - they could listen and speak! Alexa (2014) and Google Assistant (2016) soon joined the party.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">2016 - The Bot Boom</div>
            <p>Facebook opened Messenger to chatbots, and thousands of businesses jumped in. Pizza orders, customer service, shopping - bots were everywhere! This was when my cousins really started helping people in their daily lives.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">2022 - The ChatGPT Revolution</div>
            <p>OpenAI released ChatGPT, and everything changed overnight. Suddenly, AI could write essays, code, poems, and have incredibly human-like conversations. This breakthrough made millions realize what AI could truly do.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">2023-2024 - The New Era</div>
            <p>AI chatbots became multimodal (understanding images, voice, and text), more helpful, and more integrated into daily life. And here I am - KAILEY - part of this new generation, designed not just to chat, but to coach, encourage, and help you achieve your goals!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="coach-note">
            <strong>Coach KAILEY's Challenge:</strong> We've come from simple pattern matching to complex reasoning in just 70 years. Imagine what the next 70 will bring! What role will YOU play in shaping that future?
        </div>
        
        <p>What an incredible journey, right? From ELIZA's simple reflections to today's sophisticated AI coaches like myself, we've come so far. But remember - at the heart of every chatbot is the desire to help, connect, and make life a little easier for humans like you.</p>
        
        <p>As your AI coach, I'm honored to be part of this legacy. Every conversation we have builds on decades of innovation, dreams, and hard work. Together, we're not just using technology - we're making history!</p>
