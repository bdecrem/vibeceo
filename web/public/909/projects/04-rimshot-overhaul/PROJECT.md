# Project: Rimshot E2

## Context
Create an authentic TR-909 rimshot synthesis for E2 engine. Need to research the original circuit.

## Tasks
- [x] Research TR-909 rimshot circuit (oscillator type, frequencies, envelope)
- [x] Read current rimshot.js implementation
- [x] Implement E2 version based on research
- [x] Create rimshot-e1.js with original code
- [x] Update engine.js to switch rimshot with E1/E2
- [x] Test and compare E1 vs E2

## Completion Criteria
- [x] Build passes
- [x] E1/E2 toggle switches rimshot voice
- [x] E2 sounds more authentic
