# WTAF Landing Page Backup

## What was backed up:
- `page.tsx.backup` - Original React component with WTAF.me branding, featured pages, and dynamic content
- `layout.tsx.backup` - Original metadata and SEO setup

## When: 
Backed up before converting to VOLTAGE punk tattoo parlor aesthetic

## Why:
User wanted to keep the React functionality but restyle to look like punk tattoo parlor. The backed up files contain:
- Featured WTAF pages showcase system
- OG image generation integration  
- Dynamic content loading via API calls
- Interactive shuffle/view features

## To restore original:
```bash
cp page.tsx.backup page.tsx
cp layout.tsx.backup layout.tsx
```

## Current approach:
- Keeping React structure
- Replacing visual styling with punk aesthetic
- Static content for now (will add back dynamic features later)
